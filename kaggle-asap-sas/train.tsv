26328	10	1	light gray ::  I think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog. The dog would feel most comfertable in a light colerd house in t he summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature. But in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze. The dog would want to be warm in the winter. In the expirament the black heated to 53(DEG)C an d the white heated to 42(DEG)C witch is a difference of 11(DEG)C. That is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black, white or dark gray.

Also in the last paragraph he tells how the tiny peices of debris still plays a big part in space.
12031	5	3	First, the mRNA goes to a ribosome.  It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome.  The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA.  This forms an amino acid.  This continues to happen until you have a long chain of amino acids and the mRNA tells the tRNA to stop decoding.
3409	2	1	Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
3732	2	2	Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic.

3674	2	2	A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.

2846	2	2	a.) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability. The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A. b.) One way the validity of the results could have done more trials. Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break.
15314	6	0	One process would be cell growth and metabolism , because to move you need to have the right metabolism so you have the energy to even move in the first place.     A second process could be protein synthesis , because you obviously need all the protein you can get to keep you moving throughout the days of hard work.      A third process is the creation of cells , this is a big part of cell movement. You cant just have one cell and expect it to do everything like move, create energy,etc.
23552	9	2	It is organized in an interesting way.  It says what the article is about and then describes what space junk is.   After that it shows how space junk could be harmful.  Then even if it's a small amount it could be a very big affect on us all.
3931	2	1	Based on the data documented in the table I can conclude that over that plastic type D has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.Two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to: specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.This would make the validity higher.

23119	9	2	First, the author grabs the readers attention by making an awkward yet interesting opening statement, which is 'It's a . . . tool bag?' The next passage after that becomes a little more serious to make the reader understand how harmful space junk can be.      Then in the next section, the author gives the reader background information on space junk. That is important to people can understand what space junk is and how space equipment becomes space junk. That section connects well the Crash Couse section, which tells the reader some specific information about crashes in space.     The final section explains in an elaborate way how harmful space junk can be and what cause it can have in the future. So overall, the author goes from grabbing the readers attention,  to giving background information for understanding, to specific details and events, and then finally the effects and future effects space junk can have.

3134	2	3	Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this

You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
26691	10	2	dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the o ptimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors, dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature. This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it, and c ooler then black in the summer, because it is a lighter shade than black. This will occur from the dark gray paint, because in the experiment, the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53(DEG). The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42(DEG). The use of a light gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45(DEG), and the u se of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48(DEG). T his shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature, and ideal for a dogho use, because its tempurature was 6(DEG) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure, and 5(DEG) cooler then the hottest tempurature, making dark gray me dium in tempurature, and optimal for a dog house.

20596	8	2	I feel that the background information that Paul discovered about Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation.  Paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until Mr. Leonard helped Paul to achieve jumping hurdles.  Even though Paul was good at jumping hurdles, he felt as though he wasn't good enough.  When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard went to college for jumping hurdles but that Mr. Leonard flunked out, it make Paul want to try harder in multiple things.  He wanted to try to get better at hurdles, but he also wanted to finally learn how to read so that he didn't end up like Mr. Leonard.  Paul even decided that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve something, he was going to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
6667	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, meaning they can only survive in a certain area. This is because the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala eats almost only eucalyptus leaves. The python however is different because it is a generalist. They can handle change and adapt to it, making it easy for them to find food almost anywhere.

21120	8	0	The author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story. The foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well.       The author begins by introducing Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor. This suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor. When Mr. Leonard ask Paul what his name is in paragraph 24, it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass. Another incident like this occurs when Paul shows Mr. Leonard his printout, and Mr. Leonard responds with a confused look.      The author's uses of foreshadowing allows the reader to get to know Mr. Leonard personally before the information is revealed to the main character Paul.
5927	3	2	Pandas are similar to koalas Australia because they both rely on one food source. Pandas can only survive on their bamboo while koalas can only survive on their eucalyptus leaves.

These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.

I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement.'' This shows that while the article implies a meaning, it doesn't hold time for other people throughout the article."
3666	2	1	A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials.

3273	2	3	The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.

I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf. I belive that information made Paul think of his future and how him and Mr. Leonard aren't that different. Also, when Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him.

This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating.
3365	2	2	Plastic A was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic D was the weakest as it stretched the most. ^P One way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data. The second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength.

The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.

18183	7	2	In her conversation with Anna, the reader can see that Rose realizes the extent of her responibilities and duties to her family, specifically her brother. However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.' Rose's responses to Anna, such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for Anna to see how she really feels.

26161	10	2	light gray ::  The color chosen will affect the inside of th e doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts. From the experiment, black attracted the most heat (or air temperature) with an average of 53(DEG)C, and dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, light gray had 45(DEG)C, and the color white with 42(DEG)C on average. Based on these results, i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat, fewer than darker colors, but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment, the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat. Therefore, light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse.

23816	9	1	The author organizes the article from information of the past of space junk to information of the present and how dangerous it can be. For example, it starts off in the first part stating, 'Over the past 52 years... Earth's atmosphere.' This shows the variety and past of spacecraft. The next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another. This part leads into the present. Then, finally it shows that how serious space debris is by statating, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' The way the article is wrote is to show the effects of space activity.

11185	5	1	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes into the ribosomes, where it is first used to create tRNA. The ribosome then uses this tRNA to 'fetch' the appropriate amino acids from the cell as specified by the RNA's sequence. After returning these amino acids to the ribosome, the ribosome pieces together the protein that the RNA specified with the amino acids. Finally, the protein is released and used for whatever it is intended to be used for.

Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.

6535	3	1	Pandas and koalas are forced to stay in their habitats (China and Australia, respectively) because they need certain things to survive. What they eat is not available all round the world, so they have to stay in their natural habitat. However, pythons can move from continent to continent, because they are able to adapt and eat other things. This is exemplalory in, ''...there's a speculation that Hurricane Andrew...played a factor in a wholesale python jail break in 1992.'' They were able to adapt, unlike pandas and koalas.

5730	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are very similar because they both mainly eat one thing that is abundant in their habitat. Pandas eat almost only bamboo which they can easily find in China wildlife koala bears mainly eat eucalyptus leaves, which is widely available to them in Australia. Pythons are different because they are carnivores and don't only thing on one thing. According to the article, pythons can eat anything from mice to alligator.
3353	2	1	The conclusion I can draw from based on the student's data is that A.B increased, while C decreased and D stayed the same. 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment. They should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: They should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started.

In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most. ^p One way they student can improve the validity of their results is by adding a third trial. Also, you can measure each type of plastic to be the same exact size, length, and width. By doing this it will make sure that the size of the plastic doesn't affect how much it streches.
24060	9	2	The author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way.  First the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader. Other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings. The author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories. The subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk.' this can simply be seen through the subtitles themselves; What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
3578	2	2	a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put.

131	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.

The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.

8489	4	1	"Invasive is used throughout the article to show that reptiles can be shown as a threat people think that the term ""invasive"" for a specias is not right at that it is a ""passing judgement"" yet people such as biologst say that invasive species are threats to biodiversity."
9031	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" refers to foreign species being introduced. Phythons are an invasive species because they have been invading Florida and spreading all over the south. The word is significant to the rest of the article because it explains how phythons have been invading Florida and disrupting certain creatures. For example, when the phython swallowed an alligator & exploded."

An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching. The students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more.
26839	10	2	white ::  White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color.

He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution.

ATP is active transport where the substances latch on to receptor proteins and then are able to get inside the cell.Another type of movement to allow substances across the cell membrane is diffusion.  These substances move from high concentration to low concentration.  Therefore, substances are able to move into the cell or outside of it through diffusion.A third process used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane is thier protein channels.  The protein channels allow certain things to come through.

In the article RobRoy Mac Innes says that "" Tey're introduced"" is more proper as he is probably saying they're not so "" invasive and for just newly being used as pets."
182	1	3	First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
20843	8	2	The information he learned gave him comfidence to help Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard helped him.  Paul tells Mr. Leonard it is time to start training meaning its time to start learning.  Paul also now could relate to Mr. Leonard better.
20844	8	0	During the story Paul gets some backround information about Mr. Leonard. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records and was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul learns Mr. Leonard was an outstanding athlete, but not a good student. As the story continues, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard could not read and then flunked out of school. Mr. Leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed.

9042	4	1	The word invasive is significant because some reptiles are invasive creatures and the government says there are many threats because of invasive creatures, some people, such as MacInnes, says ''even the term 'invasive species' is unfair'' because he supports the spreading of the creatures, so it's arguable.
6071	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because of the climate and environment. They are both different from pythons because pythons and other snakes usually go far the forest like environment.
20509	8	2	The information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard is that he couldn't read in school either, but he broke records. Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how good of an athlete he was. Paul was also shocked to the discovery that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. Paul knew that Mr. Leonard was probably embrassed because he couldn't read and Paul knew how it felt.
20138	8	1	Paul found information on the website Mr. Leonard asked him to look up. He found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete in college. Leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at Nationals, but he couldn't continue on in college because his grades were poor. Leonard didn't want Paul to be like him. He wanted paul to be able to be a reader and a athlete at the same time. So he helped paul train and Paul helped him how to read.

20004	8	0	Paul knew nothing about Mr. Leonard before he started having conversations with him. The most Paul knew about him, was that Mr. Leonard was the hall monitor, and that most of the other students obeyed him on a regular basis. When the coach gave Paul the URL and told him to do some research on Mr. Leonard, it had a great effect on him when he did it. He realized that this man was just trying to help him to overcome a 'hurdle' in his life and that he meant well. Mr. Leonard did this, hoping that Paul wouldnt get stuck in the same position he did and that Paul could overcome it while he still had a chance, and the ability to do so.
24162	9	2	This article is organized with a fairly common format. First is a small, shocking anecdote, which serves to grab the attention of the reader. Then are a few sections highlighting the necessary details the reader needs to know to fully understand the problem such as an explanation of how space junk comes to be and how space junk is so dangerous. These are followed by a conclusion paragraph highlighting the most important information to help the message sink in one last time.

If Rose expresses her true feelings, then she is afraid that Anna will lose faith in their situation as well. In paragraph 11, Rose explains, with a maternal tone, how her and Anna have to appreciate what Paul is doing for them. He is going to school so he can get a job, and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds. Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul. Rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up, how she is tired of working so much, and how school is constantly weighing down on her. Despite these feelings, Rose tries to remain positive for Anna's sake, and holds her tongue.
18303	7	1	A trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be that they are both hard wroking. A detail would be that Aunt Kolab offered to find a job to help out with Rose being so weighed down.

When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
1655	1	2	To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.

2921	2	1	Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic.

17221	7	1	Rose is a very respectful person. While she was talking with her aunt she did not want to tell her how she truly felt because she believed it would upset her, and the rest of the family. Rose likes to put other people before herself. She is a caring person but she sometimes doesn't understand when it is to much. After talking with her aunt she realized that she couldnt weigh herself down with other peoples problems. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That quote is from the story, and that quote is what made me infer what type of person Rose was. She does her best to help people, especially the ones she loves, and in the end she is just weighing herself down. That is the heart of a true caring person, and not only a caring person, but a strong person as well.

This feeling was the way he felt when he was in fromt of other students and wasn't sure of an answer or couldn't read a passage.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' supports the my opinion that Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels.  The effect of Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul choose to help Mr. Leonard in reading, just as he had helped Paul overcome the obstacle of jumpin hurdles.  This is shown in this passage from the story, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.  Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'

Paul was on his way to the Learning Center because he cant read and Mr. Leonard was a good track player like Paul but the problem was that he couldnt read either. So Mr. Leonard did not want the same thing that happened to him, happen to Paul because he knows he had something going for himself until he flunked out of college. It would probably make him proud to see Paul pick up his mistakes, run track and know how to read.

12699	5	1	The mRNA must bond with a tRNA first and then get the tRNA anticodon to match up with the codon on mRNA.  This means AGC will have to be pair with UCG.  Then after they break off the tRNA breaks off from the mRNA and goes to the ribsomes for them to make the proteins from the animo acids. Basically it is Transcription, Translocation, and then transferring the proteins to the ribsomes to make the protein. To make the protein the ribsomes must match them in that certain order, which with a new RNA molecule, rRNA, and recieve the information from the tRNA and make the protein with chemicals.

11486	5	1	mRNA takes the message that it needs more proteins and makes sure that it gets to the ribosomes, where the proteins are made. the ribosomes start making proteins and when they are done send the proteins for their final packaging to the Golgi Apparatus. The Golgi polisheses and finishes the synthesis of the proteins and send them out in the cell where the are needed.
5269	3	1	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because they have a very limited diet that for pandas is bamboo and eucalyptus leaves for koala bears, and they are both endangered because pythons have a larger variety in food so survival is easier for them.
6321	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists, they survive on a very specific food source and a specific environment. However, pythons are generalists in that they don't require a specific food source and climate to survive. Subsequently, pythons can spread much farther than pandas and koalas.

The next two paragraphs explian what space junk is. It tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space. They raise the awarness of what is happening in space and how it could be a problem in the future.      The section titled Crash Cousrse tells us the problem. It says how it is not safe and how an accident happend in space with all the debris flying around.       Finally, the last section tells us how we can care. Clean-up is possible. But, it is still dangerous in space. Many fragments float around that cannot be detected. It also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free.

6765	3	1	Pandas and koalas are both classified as a specialist species. For example, panda's in China exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas in Australia stick to eucalyptus leaves as their main diet. However, both of these animals are different than the python. Pythons are defined as a generalist species. If a python is moved from its original habitat to one similar it will adapt easily. A python diet is mainly composed of other animals. A python is easier to feed than a panda or koala.

By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. Then the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. As you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased. As you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. So I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results.

3278	2	2	In conclusion, out of the 4 tested polymer plastics, plastic type B proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during T1 and 23 mm during T2. One way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable. A second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched.
3878	2	3	It can be concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics, and that plastic type A is the least stretchiest. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic.

After this the author describes the history of space travel and the space race as well as describing what happens to technology that is broken and just floating around in space in the section 'What is Space Junk?'.  Then in the section 'Crash Course' the author describes how satellites and debris collide and the effects of the collision.  After this point the author describes the horrible impacts of small microdebris on other space ships and satellites and what engineers and scientists are doing to counteract this in the section 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal.'

In the conclusion section, the author wraps up the article with the main problems space junk poses
3822	2	2	a). The students could conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials, after it was stretched. ^p b. One way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4, how many pound of weight are being stretched. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down. Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.

23256	9	2	I think the author did a fine job with organizing this article. By getting the reader's attention in the introduction with dialouge, I became interested about what this article would help me learn about. After the introduction, the author spent his or her time informing the reader about what 'space junk' really is. Next, the author showed the reader how the pieces of debris collide with eachother. Finally, the last paragraphs were to show the reader how important 'space junk' is and how much NASA and other space exploring organizations are concerned with it.
8123	4	1	The word ''invasive'' refers to the introduction of nonnative species into the environment which can harm the preexisting species. For example, Burmese python ''are imperiling five endangered species in the Florida keys.''

27341	10	2	white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors. In the experiment, they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG). The black lid was 53(DEG), the dark gray was 48(DEG), and lastly, the light gray was 45(DEG). Therefore, we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less.
317	1	0	After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
17363	7	0	Rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings.  The reason I say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says, Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabaly her aunt would tell her mother.
26594	10	1	black :: Black will affect the dog house and make it h otter, because black atracts the sun

In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
18644	7	2	Caring-she cares because she didn't want to answer her aunt truthfully whenever she knew that it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
9415	4	1	The significance of the word invasive relates to a species that is taken and its natural habitat and placed elsewhere. It relates to this article because many people are using reptiles as pets in places that aren't the pets natural habitat, these reptiles are ''invading'' new areas at the globe.

313	1	3	Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.

26525	10	2	white :: White because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun.In the experiment Brandi and Jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb. So that's why white is the b est color to choose to make a new doghouse.Because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun.

In Crash Course, the author gives a story of what happen in February 2009 between two dead satellites and introing the paragraph into the next paragraph.In Little Bits, but a Big Deal, explain the affects of sapce juck. Once the tiny fragments hits any spacecraft or satillites, they could cause serious damage like and affect space obervations in the future.

3848	2	2	Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data. Not only that plastic type ,B, was the strongest, it stretched the farthest too. Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways. The student should have told, how heavy the weights were. Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design.

3292	2	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
3047	2	0	The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.

The word is also interperated differently among people such as Rob Roy MacInnes new of the term invasive as unfair and thinks introduced would be a better word for the animals."
1182	1	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples. The amount of vinegar that each container would need.

Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis. Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane.

For instance, the panda bear only feasts on bamboo while the koala bear only eats eucalyptus leaves. Yet a python contrasts both these creatures since a python is a generalist. These animals can live anywhere because they are most abundant like humans.

23395	9	2	The author organizes this atricle in 4 different sections. The first section is the introduction in which the author grabs the reader's attention to become interested in the topic. Then, the second section is titled 'What Is Space Junk?' and this section has 2 paragraphs specifically talking about space junk. Next, there are 2 paragraphs about crash courses with the title of 'Crash Course'. Lastly, there are 4 paragraphs explaining how even if the debris is small in size, it has a major impact. Therefore, this article is neatly organized in 4 different sections.
17911	7	1	Rose is always trying to be positive in the way she talks to people. The conversation with her sister proves this point because Rose is telling her about how everything will be alright, and that Paul will help us, her dad will be coming back, and her mom will be too.

5112	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar. They are both similar because as said in the article they are both specialist that need to inhabit certain areas because they only eat a certain food. But they are different from pythons because pythons are able to inhabit different climates and eat different foods as other generalist animals.

2950	2	3	(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. This is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example, plastic B stretched 22 mm in the first trial but plastic D the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm. The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials. This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have also tell how many weights to add at a time, so that they, and whoever else does this experiment remains constant.
27567	10	1	white :: i think it would be white because then when i t is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then i t would be when the dog house is white.
26312	10	2	light gray ::  Light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors. Dark colors do not reflect light well, instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures. In winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.

14285	6	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. Diffusion is the process of substances moving across a membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration, or with the concentration gradient. Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles. Active transportation is the process of substance moving through a membrane against the concentration gradient, or from low to high concentration.

18212	7	1	A trait that Rose has is caring about her family. She's not selfish at all. In the story Rose states that money isn't everything and even though she missed her father she understood that he had to go to Los Angeles for the money.
21525	8	0	The effect that this information has on Paul is tremendous becasue it shows that Mr.Leonard is a person just like him. In the story when Mr. Leonard asks Paul where he is going and he responds the learning center Mr.Leonard just srugs it off because he knows he has been there. Another example is when Mr.Leonard asks Paul to meet him after school he is trying to hepl him in life.Lastly Mr. Leonard is discuraged when he is reminded of his past but when Paul helps him he feels better.
23675	9	1	The author organizes the article by telling the information to the reader in order and is not all scrambled up. The author talks about Space Junk and what it is. He tells us what it does and how it acts in space. Then he talks about its crash course and about how the little pieces of rock can cause serious damage to the spacecraft.
1134	1	2	Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
21007	8	2	I think that the information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes him respect him more, because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach. I also think that Paul felt alot more comfortable with Mr. Leonard when he found out that he couldn't read because he felt like he could relate to Mr. Lenord more.
17617	7	1	Rose is caring and wants to help. She is understanding and when talking to her sister and aunt she expresses how she feels but also understands how she needs to help out.
18041	7	0	She feels very stressed out. Why is that, because the story says, 'She felt to young for so much responsibility'.
27067	10	1	white :: This color will be best because when its hot outside, the doghouse will be cooler than if they painted it black or a d arker color.

17569	7	0	Rose seems to have many traits in this story. But the one that sticks out the most to me is being independent. Rose has a lot of different obstacles but she seems to be alone. Even though she is not forced she feels it has to be done and without her everything will fail. Anna seems to help her refocus and give her some positive feedback but Rose just seems to get even more upset and become once again independent about her issues. An example from the story would be 'Anna,' Rose said. ' What's wrong? You feel okay? 'I'm fine,' her sister said.

All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways. The experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air te mperature inside the jar. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat. Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse. So its not too warm for the dog, but if the dog gets ho t, it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep.

1425	1	3	After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.

Some of the sections included: 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' In 'What Is Space Junk', it described what space junk actually is. Its says that some of the disabled objects become a piece of high-tech junk, and it cirlces the globe in uncontrolled orbit. In the next section, 'Crash Course', it talks about a time when two communications satellites crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth. In the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', it talks about how tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. It also states that the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commerical space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.

Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.

To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
5771	3	1	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are alike because they are both specialists. They both mainly eat one type food that is found in their habitat. On the other hand, pythons are generalists. They eat whatever they can find. In the article it states that generalists can live anywhere that is the main difference.
12679	5	2	The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole, only sizable for it. It then goes to the ribosome. Once its in, the tRNA begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three. The strand leaves the ribosome in pairs of three, the amino acid sequence to make the protiens we need.
959	1	3	After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples.

Then explains how many people actually care about the satellites traveling really fast just above them. 'The disabled object become a piece  of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontolled orbit.' The author does a magnificient job at organizing this article because it explains the history, how harmful they can be, and that many people care about it.

18427	7	0	Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way.
20276	8	2	When Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard he was surprized because he didnt know that Mr. Leonard had went to college and won the 4oo meter dash. So Paul asked him 'What happened after that?', and Mr. Leonard told him and you could tell of the sad emotions in his voice of being a good athlete but, not having the good grades to continue on the track team even when your freinds are trying to help you and its all because you dont how to read.      When Paul thought about that and it occured to him that Mr. Leonard had taken the time to help him excel at track he know what to and he said 'come on Mr. Leonard its time to start your training.'

Passive transport does not require energy, the molecules just pass through the membrane. And diffusion is the the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.
4921	3	2	Pandas in China only eat bamboo and Koalas in Australia eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves. They are both restricted to one food while pythons eat a varity of foods potentially harming native species.
1644	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.

20498	8	2	When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's past track excellence, he becomes inquisitive, then empithetic.  Paul's natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting Mr. Leonard about the startling information he discovered online.  His continued curiosity is demonstrated through his continual questioning and prying such as in '`But you went to college,'' and 'I pressed'.' Paul later becomes empethetic when he offers to 'train' Mr. Leonard how to read and when Paul states ' The emotions in Mr. Leonards voice were all to familiar to [Paul].'  When Paul confronts Mr. Leonard, his natural curiosity turns to empathy.

5762	3	2	Panda in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist. Pandas can only eat bamboo and koalas can only eat eucalyptis. This makes it hard for the m to survive anywhere else. They are different form pythons because pythons are generalist. Pythons can eat, really anything and live anywhere making survival easy.
9131	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is dangerous in the article, it says ""I think that invasive is passing judgement"" which means they are judging a animal they don't really know. To some people pythons are invasive species and a python could be dangerous."

91	1	3	I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.

803	1	1	The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
20609	8	2	Paul feels motivated to work harder at track because he has good grades and he can read which is something Mr. Leonard never had.

4993	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Aus because they are both anunaunt  and specialists that eat bamboo &,eucalyptus leaves so they can't be harmful to humans. They live in a certain place, unlike pythons which are generalists so they can rang from Florida to Antartica to outer space.
17400	7	0	Rose tells Anna and Aunt Kolab that she is in some way being weighed down. Rose had a dream that Paul was holding her down.
3706	2	2	Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp.
3275	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability. Also plastic type A has the least stretchability. The student could have had another trial.
1116	1	3	The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
9738	4	0	The word invasive is significant to the article because it means that someone's pet can be a threat to someone else beause the pet may be to dangerous to have as a pet.
5804	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas because they can survive in the same climate. But are different from pythons because pythons can survive in any climate for example in the story were food spread all over the U.S.
17715	7	0	Rose is sympthatic person towards Anna.  When Anna came in to the kitchen at the start of the story Rose asked, 'Whats wrong.'  Anna said, 'I'm fine, I just had another bad dream.'

27195	10	1	black :: the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot.
27556	10	2	dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C. Dark Gray as you see isn't too wa rm, neither too cold, making it the best color for the doghouse.
1127	1	2	To replicate the experiment I would need to know the substance used as the sample.I also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup. The starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment.
26999	10	0	black :: it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
18074	7	0	One trait than can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is sincere. An example that supports my answer is that when Anna was walking in the kitchen, rubbing her eyes.
20206	8	2	He realizes that they are much a like. They both have trouble reading. It changes the way he looks at Mr. Leonard.
27068	10	1	black :: Black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the dog house a hot temperature.
3570	2	2	A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm. Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm, 23m T2. And type C, D were C, 14 T1mm, 13 T2mm, D 20T1mm, 20 T2mm. Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it. To improe and compare data. Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic. To keep data acorte.

12396	5	1	There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.
1489	1	2	To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.

18487	7	2	Rose is a very hard worker and cares about her and her sisters education.     'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
20327	8	0	The effect it has on Paul is a good effect because he decides to help Mr. Leonard in the end
18075	7	0	Over run, Rose is so busy with all of her responsibilities that she has reached a point of hoplesness.  Ahe also feels wieghed down by her brother and his  hard times.
536	1	1	Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
21724	8	2	The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story. By learning that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, we know that he and Paul have the same problem. Paul who we know can't read turns out to be a great athlete but can't read. Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well. Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete. He can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college.
24269	9	1	The author oraganized this article with three different titles that are important about space and what people put out there.
8469	4	1	"Invasive is important because it shows the bias against the new species, "" Even the term 'invasive species' is unfair, they're introduced; I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement"". This is important because the article talks about how invasive species were invading other new ecosystems and, are a major threats to biodiversity"", which shows how invasive is representing a bias towards the generalist species because of that harm they do."
9741	4	2	"MacInnes feels that the term ""Invasive species"" is unfair. He feels these animals are ""introduced"". This term is very important to this article because it talks about the introduction of new animals in the U.S. and their ability to thrive in the new envirornment. These ""invasive species"" are controversial because they could threat biodiversity majorly."
24577	9	2	the author goes through many diiferent paragraphs and sections. For example, One section is called 'What is space junk?' and there are two paragraphs in that section.
26499	10	2	black :: If they use black paint on the doghouse then the doghouse will be hotter than with any other color. In the experiment the black lid's average temperature was 53 degrees and all the other colo rs were more cold.
16973	7	1	One trait that can descirbe Rose is responsible. It seems like she is responsible for so much in her and her families life. For example, when she has to work her work shift and help her Aunt Kolab in paragraph 2.
18320	7	0	One trait that describes Rose is that she is selfish. Instead of being happy for Paul she only sees Paul's graduation as an obstacle weighing her down.
14009	6	0	one is the edoplamick reticulum. and two is the cell mimbraint.
27260	10	1	black :: becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54 , the other colors get less then that
5794	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because ''China's pand, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.'' They are different from pythons because pythons eat mostly anything.
27433	10	1	light gray :: the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
22966	9	1	It talks about what space junk is. Then it talks about times junk has been sent out to space. Eventually it talks about how space junk can be a serious matter.
8287	4	0	The significance of the word invasive is to show how the government doesn't want these animals and that people in general put bad conotation on them. In the article it said how there is a threat posed by these animals.
26082	10	1	white ::  White will be better for the doghouse because it will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat. if black was u sed it absorbs more heat then lighter colors would.
14219	6	2	Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane. Diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell. Neither of these require energy for the cell to use. Active transport, on the other hand, is a process of movement which does require energy.
20312	8	1	Paul understands how it feels to want to have your dream but you can;t because you can't read as well as others. Paul knew how the embarrasment when calling upon to read aloud and couldn't. Or didn't know the answers eeryones else in his class did. Paul took the effects as his own.
3862	2	2	a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B, and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured all dimensions length, width, heights of the plastic types rather than just the length.
3361	2	3	Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
17444	7	0	Rose was a procrastinator, in the story she put off writing her essay until last minute then she couldn't think of anything to write.
8615	4	2	"The word ""invasive"" in this article means that the species is a threat to other species living in Florida and around the south of the U.S. This shows in the title when it says ""One man's pet, another's invasive species"" which tells us that they believe that reptiles such as snakes, lizard and alligators can harm other native species in the area of Florida."
5182	3	1	"Panda bear and koalas bear are similar because like the article writen by Joel anchenchach says,""A specialist is a china's panda which almost nothing but bamboo or Australia koalas bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" It shoes that both pandas and koalas are specialist unlike pythons who are generalist."
9804	4	1	The significance of the word invasive is that the python and other reptiles are coming to areas where they don't belong. One man might like the reptile but another man sees that it will backfire on soon harm the habitat. It's living in and expand its population causing that habitat its new habitat where it will now live.
1528	1	3	First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
24123	9	2	The author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article. for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk. then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be. At the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone. That is how he organizes the article.
3332	2	0	In conclusion what all of the plastic type (A,B,C,D) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about  what type of plastic they used.
1578	1	1	This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
1006	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
6437	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both don't eat meat and they're both not invasive. The python is invasive and eats meat. The python can spread and be a danger to a lot of animals and humans but the pandas in China and koalas in Australia aren't a danger to other animals and humans.
23287	9	2	The author organizes the article first by giving the background information of the start of space exploration. They continue on to define satellites and how they are used. The second section describes how the satellites played a role in history. Then the author goes on in the last section to describe how the satellites are a problem now by explaining how they are involved in space pollution.
709	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
17843	7	2	Rose is very gentle. She is very gentle because when her sister Anna was talking about how she hated that her father had to go to Los Angeles to work, Rose was trying to talk to her and tell her that the job pays more, and that it is important, and that he was helping them for their futures.
17759	7	2	Strong. This is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical. She is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is. She works, goes and most likely excells at school because she is involved with the competition, and also helps support her family.
4061	2	3	a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
3032	2	2	A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
21312	8	1	He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
6537	3	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in the way that they are both specialists.

Light gray would be perfect, because during the summer, the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot, s o the doghouse would'nt be too warm. During the winter, the light gray wo uld absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the win ter. I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did (whe re they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature) the y found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48(DEG)C. The average temper ature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45(DEG) C. Finnaly, the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42(DEG)C. This shows that light gray absorbs some heat, bu t not alot, so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse.

Now, Paul will really work hard on learning how to read. He doesn't want to let Mr. Leonard, or himself down.
11592	5	1	The next step that is involved in protein synthesis would be after the mRNA leaves the nucleus the tRNA sends instructions to the ribosomes in order to create the protein. Which is where the DNA is then unzipped. The codons are then attached with the one strand of DNA. Once this has happend the amino acids then match up with their complementary bases to form the amino acid sequence, in order to form a protein.

11723	5	3	The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.  Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.  Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.

Painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer, thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog. The white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected, the average temperature will be aprox. 42(DEG) C, whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures (45(DEG) LGray, 48(DEG) DGray, 53(DEG) Black). The white colour was 11(DEG) coo ler than the darkest colour (black), thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house.

3063	2	2	Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
3056	2	1	This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.

The introduction also contains the thesis statement 'Orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satalite missions.' Next, the author describes what space junk is, and how it was created. After that, in the section titled 'Crash Course', the risks of colliding satellites are hilighted. Finally, in the last section, the author talks about possible solutions and the persisting problem of space junk.

18399	7	1	As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character.
15306	6	3	Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and a semi-permable membrane.  Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.
16975	7	1	Based on Rose's attitude from the story, she seems like she cares a lot about her family, but is also worried about her family. Even though she seems worried or doubtful, one line in the story she says to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' In this sentence, it sounds like she has a little bit of faith also.
18048	7	0	One trait that Rose has is that she is very cautious of others feelings and tries to not upset them. An example of this trait would be when Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighted down by what she was doing for the family, and to avoid hurting Aunt Kolab she didn't respond.

9375	4	1	The word invasive in this article most likely was being used to say reptiles as pets in the U.S. are either gross, not night or even unwanted. ''Even the tern invasive species is unfair'' says MacInnes. MacInnes believes that reptiles do have the right to be in households throughout the U.S, even if many believe snakes and lizards are invasive.
3875	2	2	"According to the results, polymer ""A"" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why ""A"" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results."

Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces.

2962	2	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest. The student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. Right now, one can only guess what weight that was. Another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic B actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes.

For example, before the author gets into defining 'space junk', there is a subtitle labeled 'What Is Space Junk?'  Also, before the author tells about the microdebris in space, there is a title labeled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
5248	3	2	Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because they are specialists. Pandas almost exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas almost exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. This means that these animals are really only able to live in certain areas, while the generalist python can feed on countless foods and can deal with a fairly large range of temperatures.

He emotionally talks about how he had gone to college on a track and field scholarship but flunked out because he couldn't read, and that really affected Paul because he knew that feeling all too well. Paul was having to go to a learning center to read so he knew exactly what Mr. Leonard went through.

20978	8	1	Paul is kind of affended that Mr. Leonard never told him because he says, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' After he found out the whole truth behind the story he had sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul is in the same struggle and can relate. He feels for Leonard because he lost his future all because he couldn't do something as simple as read but it also made him realize that he is in a struggle against reading and school too and if he doesn't over come his obstacle his future at hurdles could end like Mr. Leonards... or simply never start.

The author then goes on to explain precisely what space junk is and how it has formed in the seciton entitled, 'What IS Space Junk?' The next section, entitled 'Crash Course', goes on to explain the harm that space debris can cause to spacecraft. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' concludes the article by telling why we should care about space debris. The section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris.

86	1	3	To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.

6779	3	1	The pandas in China and the koala bears in Australia are both specialists because they only eat the native food and thrive without humans. The panda ''eats almost nothing but bamboo'' is like the koala bear who eats ''eucalyptus exclusively.'' These two are different from the ''generalist'' pythons. They thrive because they do their ''best in and around humans.''
5928	3	2	The ultimate generalist is, arguably, a human being, who with the assistance of technology can live anywhere, from Florida to Antarctica to outer space. I think panda and koalas was same specie. They were spread then appear similar species.
23547	9	2	The author organizes the article with facts of 'space junk' that are in space due to space exploration. The author then goes on to giving examples of what 'space junk' is and where it can come from. The autor gives the example of a two satellites crashing into each other, which created hundreds of pieces of debris. The author then goes on about the difficulty for a spacecraft to be in space and stay clear of the debris left by other spacecrafts and satellites. Lastly, the author summarizes the article and giving the reader the main idea of the article. The main idea is that the 'space junk' in space is increasing and still a problem for space agencies.

11377	5	3	After the mRNA leave the nucleus, there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA. The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA. The tRNA codes for an amino acid. Next, another tRNA connects to the next codon, bringing in another amino acid. The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind. The amino acids bond. This continues, creating a strand of amino acids, until a stop codon is reached. Then the chain of amino acids is released.

Paul and Mr. Leonard are similiar because they are both good at hurdles but they had trouble reading. 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out.' He wanted Paul to be a good reader so that if he gets a scholarship for hurdles than he wouldn't lose it because of his grades.

According to a experiment on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar. While a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees.
17694	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose would be concern. The morning when her and Anna talked about their dad being gone and all the problems within the family, Rose asked Anna if she was okay and Rose tried to talk to Anna and make her feel better and try to get Anna to believe everything that was happening was happening for a good reason/cause.
15267	6	3	As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.
23707	9	1	The author organizes the article by explaining what space junk is and what it can do to Earth and surrounding satellites. Then, the autho goes on to explain about why space junk is going to increase.
14257	6	1	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the sodium potassium pump, endocytosis, and exocytosis.      The sodium potssium pump pumps sodium ions out and potassium ions in. It is a form of active transport,     Endocytosis moves large materials into the cell by the use of a vesicle; it is a form of active transport.     And exocytosis moves large materials out of a cell by the use of a vesicle; it is also a form of active transport.
18278	7	1	One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is hard-working. In paragraph eighteen, her aunt says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This shows that Rose is working extremely hard to help her family out financially.
27047	10	1	dark gray :: Dark Grey! because its not too dark so that t he dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm. The average temp was 48(DEG) C so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold.
27569	10	2	black ::  The color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus, Brandi and Jerry should paint th dog ho use black. According to the results from the experiment, the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy.
21226	8	0	From what I read, the backround check helped Paul feel better for himself. When Mr. Leonard told him he flunked out of college, because they didn't have a learning center. So he relied on his friends to help him pass. When Paul learned that he felt bad for Mr. Leonard. Paul decided to start training with Mr. Leonard to make him feel good about himself and show him that he did learn something.
18718	7	2	One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working. This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab, she has all these thing to do.

The article starts with information that will be reiterated through the entirety of the essay. It then builds upon that information with which it started.
6734	3	2	"Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. A Chinese Panda ""eats almost nothing but bamboo."" and a Koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"", this shows how these animals most live in one place. A Python, on the other hand , is a generalist that is not affected it depending to different climates. Pandas and Koalas cannot live without specialists."
9797	4	1	"The significance of the word ""Invasive"" is that this means species are being spread around at a high rate. This article explains the danger of it, including examples of pythons spreading across the U.S. and eating different animals, killing them all."
6671	3	1	The panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koalas eat nothing but leaves basicly the eat only one thing thats how they're similar. They're different from the pythons because in the story they talk it about how the python eats different items.

14236	6	3	Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration. Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.
4972	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia since they are both specialists that eat a certain type of food almost exclusively. They are different from pythons because pythons can live anywhere and are most abundant in or around humans.

While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/
386	1	1	First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
3173	2	0	a) In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability and plastic type A was the lowest. This shows that A is the most non-flexible and the most durable to stretchy tasks. Plastic B is the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm. ^p They could've added a list of materials in the beginners and a hypothesis to see what they were trying to test.

16960	7	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose comes across as understanding. She explains to Anna that even though it's hard on them, they each have their part to do for the family in order to help during difficult times. This shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help. Even though she feels slight resentment for this, she surpresses these feelings while explaining the situation to Anna because she understands thatn the family needs them to help out.
17908	7	2	Rose is a very understanding character in the story because obviously she doesnt like all the work she has to do and how much is getting put on her all at once.

As she says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he will get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' So she knows he responsibility, she may not like it but she know that she has to do it.
9076	4	1	"The word "" Invasive"" is significant to this article because it talks about how Pythons take over other creature's habitats. They are not native to the area and are ""invading"" the territory of the other creatures."
14546	6	2	Diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside.  This process does not require any energy.Active transport is the movement of substance from a low concentration to a high one.  This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane.  The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell.
3314	2	3	A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.

20815	8	1	Over the course of Paul's encounters with Mr. Leonard, various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner. Its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help Paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 14-23, 'Know what that...Right', I panted'.     The greatest revealation, however, is made when Paul obtains information on Mr. Leonard from his coach in paragraphs 32-33, ' 'Visit this site...with the team'. This makes Paul aware of the strengths and weaknesses that other people have, and how to symphathize with whatever difficulties they experience in their weaknesses.

11827	5	1	During protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus.  The tRNA takes the anti-codon and matches it with the corresponding codon on the mRNA molecule.  It attaches on the ribosome.    This then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain.  Once those steps are complete, you have the protein that the mRNA was coded for.
26876	10	2	black :: If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm. As in the experiment it shows that when they used the b lack lid, the temperature went from 24(DEG)C to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. And when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24(DEG)C to 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This showes that the darker the color, the great er increase in the air temperature, because the darker colors absorb more energy.

However, he didn't have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship.     I think Paul relates to what Mr. Leonard went through so well is because Paul was basically going through the same thing. He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read. Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class, but he was extremely embarrassed. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart.      Mr. Leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now. All Mr. Leonard had was friends to help him, and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better. He wants Paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read.      Paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing. He relates to Mr. Leonard and in the end, that is why he decided that he would help him and get him to read.

26625	10	2	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm. Also, when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool. I know this because when the light g ray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average an d stayed cool. However the lid was also a bit warm. The lowes t temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44(DEG)C while the highest was 46(DEG)C which, if this is the sa me with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature .

When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened, he felt for  him. Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt, the embarrasment, the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer, he could truly relate to him.      It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same. Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills. And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills.

First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment.

According to the article, pandas & Koalas are specialists who differ from pythons who are generalists. Pythons need a certain environment to live in 4 food to eat which they can't get being kept as pets
20500	8	2	When Paul learns about who Mr. Leonard was, that inspires Paul. Paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was the exact same way back in his high school years. Mr. Leonard accomplish much, by setting national records and being one of the best runner. This is told when the article says, 'You were a college freshmen who won the 400 ,eter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.' (line 38-39). This proves to Paul that even though he is unable to read well, he is still able to be the best at something else i his life.     Mr. Leonard also encourages Paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read. Mr. Leonards says, 'I lost my scholarship and flunnked out.' (line 47). This statement is important to Paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner. Paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesn't learn to read. So this encourages Paul to work hard and learn how to read.

He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.

These animals are usually thought of as harmful to the environment it lives in. This pertains to the article because one point of view considers the python invasive. According to some, these ""invasive"" animals ""are imperiling five endangered species in the Florida keys"". Those who support this statement would consider the python invasive."
5273	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are specialists. They live only in these environments because of the bamboo and eucalyptus. They can't live anywhere else or they wouldn't survive. They are different from pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere. Potentially from Delaware to Northern CA. offering a wider range.
18169	7	2	During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'

The article is seperated in different categories where that topic is explained. The author tries to emphasize the importance of the outcome we will have if people ignore this situation. With no one to control the dead satellites, they run with great risks of 'colliding with each other.' This can cause a harmful effect and is what happened in February 2009. This impact caused hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path.

First off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp.They could have also included a control.
5204	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia depend on mostly one type of food source. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo & the koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves. Therefore if they were to be placed somewhere else, in another area it would be hard for them to survive. Pythons on the other hand that are moved from their native area will try and consume any animal to survive, like the python in Everglades region that was found swallowing an alligator.
9324	4	1	I believe the significance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is to be completely out  of control. The reason why I believe this is because in the article MacInnes got offended and stated ''even the term invasive species'' is unfair. ''Reading that told me that it was something harsh enough to take offense to.

21044	8	2	The background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects Paul by giving him motivation.  Since Mr. Leonard was a successful track star back when he was in school he felt confidence that he could teach Paul how to be a successful runner as well.  Throughout the story this confidence in Paul helps motivate him to train and listen to Mr. Leonard.

In warmer tempatures, the paint will not asborb as much sunlight, so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot. The black paint had an average tempature of 53(DEG) C, while the light gray had an average tempature of 45(DEG)C. That is a difference of 8(DEG)C. The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler, but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint. The white paint had a n average tempature of 42(DEG)C. The light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3(DEG)C warmer then the white paint, but 8(DEG)C cooler tha n the black paint.

22985	9	2	The author organizes the article in a way that answers the readers questions as one would have them by putting everything under titled paragraphs. The author first gives the reader background information on the problem.  Telling one what the problem is, and how it came to be a problem in 'What IS Space Junk?'.  The author of the article then told the reader about the dangers of space junk and how they affect all things in space in 'Crash Couse'.  Finally in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author tells of more problems that space trash causes and tells one how the problem is increasing and how it is trying to be stopped, 'Space agencies hope that the corporations and nations involved can work together to come up with a viable solution to space pollution.'  This makes for a well rounded article.
20453	8	2	In the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard use to be a really good runner, but was bad at reading. This makes Paul relize that Mr. Leonard and him are the same in the way that they are both good runners, but bad readers. This gives Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read because Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run fast.
865	1	2	In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.

3675	2	2	Based on the data I can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial. Also I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most because it held the most weight. One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using. Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic.

Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.

14485	6	3	One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.
18213	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose is hard-working. The author of the story says that she feels she needs to do her part to help Paul get through college. She is working to help him because she knows he will return the favor to both her and Anna.

In the article, it says that pandas and koalas eat almost nothing but (for a panda) bamboo and (for a koala) eucalyptus. A panda and koala are different from a python because a python is a generalist, who can live practically anywhere.
8074	4	1	The significance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is that these animals are not invasive, they are being introduced to the U.S. by people like RobRay MacInnes, who import them here to sell on the market.
5339	3	1	From reading this article I can say pandas in China are much like koalas in Austrailia because both animals eat mainly one food. Pandas like to eat mainly bamboo and koalas like to eat mainly eucalyptus leaves. This quality puts both animals in the catagory of specialists. This differs from python because pythons are generalist. The article says generalists are human beings that live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space, unlike pandas and koalas.

I know this because in paragraph 21 it says ""pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo,' and 'koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.' Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are carnivores and eat meat also pandas and koalas are mammals while pythons are reptiles."
4944	3	2	Pandas and koalas are similar to each other because they both only eat one type of food, while pythons try to eat anything that moves and fit in their mouth. This means that the koalas and pandas are much more likely to go about alike because of their food sources than the pythons.
3821	2	3	Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm.

He also finds information about  Mr. Leonard being a college freshman athlete who won records and hurdled in the national race. This effected Paul because he didn't understand how after college he became a hall monitor. He was so successful. Mr. Leonard explained to him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This impacted Paul into teaching Mr. Leonard about high school and decided to step up. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'

So type B had the most stretchability .^p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type A, B, C, and D. And another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, and how many weights were used.
27466	10	2	white :: White, because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids, and from the data table it shows that black (53degr ees) was the highest, and white(42degrees) was the lowest.

Then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of 'space junk.' From this he begins explaining exactly what space junk is and when it first appeared in the atmosphere above space. After that he gives a past event from February 2009 and in 2008 as examples of how space junk occurs. Next he describes the severity of these space crashes by using details such as comparing 'grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  This comparison was used very well because it helps create an image of how bad it is when two satelites in space collide. Finally the author closes his article by telling the reader how big of a problem space junk is becoming and how space agencies are beginning to work together to put a stop to it.

To first inform the reader, the author gives a little bit of history about space travel, and then explains how space junk is created. The second part of the article then is used to explain a situation about how a crash of dead sattelites can create space junk. In the last part of the article the author gives information on why this space junk really is bad and harmful. The auhor finally ends the last part by telling us that there needs to be a way to try to find a solution to stop space pollution.

Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.

Then, an amino acid is created and the tRNA strand leaves and another one is attached to the next three codons. Thus, creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds. The chain that is created is a protein.
6470	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because they are both specialist meaning they always eat the same food. For example Koala's eat the eucalyptus leaves and a Panda eats bamboo. They are both different from pythons because pythons vary their foods.

1420	1	1	In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
20507	8	2	The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation. I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading. After discovering that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul immediately wanted to help him as Mr. Leonard had helped Paul with the hurdles. Paul saw that not being able to read had damaged Mr. Leonard's life and he felt the need to help Mr. Leonard. Paul shows this by saying 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Also, seeing their similarities motivated Paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles. This is the effect which Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
7	1	1	The information I would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment, also the materials that was used to creat the experiament. After the 24 hours, of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water.

Rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is. This story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you.
5078	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Pandas eat mostly only bamboo and koalas eat mostly only eucalyptus leaves. Both species would not respond well to change unlike pythons which are generalists. Pythons can respond well to change and can be seen in multiple locations.
18208	7	2	Rose is hardworking. She goes to school, then heads off to the resaurant she works at for her four-hour shift, heads home to help her Aunt make a quick super, and then she started on her homework.

He then provides information on what space junk is so the reader has a clear idea in their head. After, he explains what happens in space with all the different satelites and how dangerous they can be. then the last paragraph is there to show how important it is to know about all the space junk in space.
5858	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are not like pythons at all. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. In the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator and exploded. This shows that pythons will try to eat anything if their habitat is changed.

26543	10	2	black ::  I chose black because black is going to keep the dog house warmer. If they paint the dog house white, the light will just reflect off, butt if they choose black then they will keep the warm, I know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but the average temperature with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. So black would be the best color for the dog house.

Of course, it doesn't mean that she is happy about it all the time, but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can.
1428	1	0	The three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. At the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. At the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each.
24094	9	2	The interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about. What is Space Junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there. Crash Course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher. And the last paragraph tell how all this is really a big deal and something should be done about it.
17599	7	2	You can tell that she cares about her little sister. In the story, she tries to calm her little sister down by saying that once they help pay for Paul to graduate, then they will be able to go to college and get good jobs. She's making sure that Anna knows everything will be alright.

23022	9	0	I think that the author organization is kind of messy, but kind of not. In the beginning, he starts off with a wild introduction, but that made me interested in reading it. Then he goes off talking about different topics, making it pretty organized because atleast he has a title to make the readers know that they are going to learn something different.
20224	8	1	Paul begins to feel empathetic for Mr. Leonard because he knows what it's like to fell embarrassed when he was called upon to read and couldn't or didn't know quite as much as the other kids. I think he also realizes that there are others that have reading problems and can set those aside and work hard to achieve set goals.
24625	9	0	The author organizes the article in a logical order. He grabs your attention and then tells you the facts. He then tells history and why space debris is a problem.
14634	6	0	One process used by cells to control the movement of a substance is that the nucleous. An other way the cell controls movement is when the ribosomes carry information from one  thing in a cell to another. Lastly is when the RNA and DNA make up sequences telling what should happen in  the movement of the cell.
20113	8	1	When Paul gets background information in Mr. Leonard, he sees that, just like Paul, he struggled with reading and was also a runner.  Paul foreshadowed Mr. Leonard's story growing up through high school and college.

The nucleus begins to dissapear. The chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center. The next stage is anaphase where the centromere splits and each centromere goes to a pole. In telophase the cell then slpits in half to form two cells.
5862	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialist and eat plants that grow in one area. Pythons can live in more places than pandas or koalas because they can eat mainly panda and are going to new places to live like U.S.

5487	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are specialists. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. But pythons will eat anything. One time a python tried to eat an alligator whole which is something a panda or koala would never do.
1426	1	2	Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
6276	3	1	In the article pandas and koalas are labeled as specialist who eats greens ( bamboo and eucalyptus leaves) pandas and koalas have to be around their own creatures and their daily supply of food. Pythons, on the other hand, can tolerate being in the same environment as humans due to the support of technology. they are generalists that are capable to survive being around humans.

23803	9	1	First, the author describes what space junk is then gives you a short history of space explorations. Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space.

1342	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
3620	2	3	a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.

23557	9	1	The author starts out explaining that remains of satellites that have been destroyed now clutter the pathways around Earth and how it is a concern to space agencies around the globe. Then the author tells about the history of satellites that have been launched into space and how a couple collided a couple of years ago and have now created a bunch of debris that cause major damage to space shuttles.
1614	1	2	The additional information I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. I will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor.
3001	2	3	Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
6726	3	1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas because they are both specialists and need certain things  to survive while pythons are generalist and need less specific things to survive. We live in an age that favors generalists rather than specialists. Pythons are different because of how they adopt.
4035	2	2	In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.

18646	7	1	Rose cares about her family more than anything.
23378	9	1	The author organizes the article by starting out with facts and differnt information and slowly flows the things and topics together. The author ends the first section with 'The disabled object becomes a pieces of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrollable orbit' and starts the new one going off that, 'With no one at the controls...' The second section is ended with '...a tool bad escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs on the Internation Space Station' and the next section begins 'So who cares about a lost tool bad or tiny bits of space trash?'
22995	9	1	The author organizes this article by first catching your attention. After the author has caught your attention, he goes into an explaination of what space junk is and it's harmful effects. Then the author explains what we could do to come up with a solution to space pollution.
684	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need the size the four containers are, what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is. And how much vinegar the students poured into each container.
8481	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the article because the author argues that reptile that kill other animals are misunderstood rather than invasive. Invasive means dangerous and the government classifies pythons to be invasive, while the author says they are not."

6397	3	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are able to survive on a one type of food. As stated in the article that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bears that eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. Both of the bears are different from pythons because pythons eat animals that could be endangered while koalas and pandas eat only leaves.

The article shows the different viewpolets on whether they are unwelcome and any rout or great additions to our wildlife as MacInnes says, ""They're introduced."" He believes invasive is unfair, while others fear the reptiles."
5604	3	0	Pandas are similar to Koala's because they are both specialists, they both eat pretty much one food sourse and that's it. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, they will eat anything plus they are scaled while Koalas and Pandas have far.

18574	7	2	Rose is a sympathetic person. She does not like hurting other people. In paragraph 19 it says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
1038	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.

23207	9	1	The author starts off with an introduction from the point of view then the author gives a little information about how there has been some crashes between a American and Russian traveling at 20,000 miles/hour! Also on how if the tools are dropped that they can be very harmous. They even use sand being shot from a cement wall.
24403	9	2	The author organizes this article by seperating the information into different catagories.  He begins with a simple introduction to hook the reader.  Then he goes on to explain what space junk is and how it is formed.  The third section describes the dangerous collisions that take place in space between the different satellites and such.  The very last section states that even small bits of space debris can cause a big problem.  Overall, the author did a great job of informing the reader about his point of view.
3026	2	3	Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.
23112	9	2	The author uses titles that break the article down into smaller categories to organize the text. The titles gives the reader a little information about what the next section will mainly be about, like 'Crash Course'. The reader would get the hint that that paragraph would mainly be about things colliding. The author also splits the text up into paragraphs that have the same idea. It helps organize the ideas and keeps the same subject in an area.
8843	4	1	The significance of the word invasive is that many animals like pythons are invading other territories because they can survive in many places. With that some endangered animals could become extinct due to pythons eating them for food.
6653	3	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, they eat a specific food in order to survive. (paragraph 21). They are both different than the python because the python is a generalist, which eats almost anything to survive. ""Its no accident that species that have become abundant are often those that do best in human and around humans."""
6204	3	0	Pandas and koalas are both specialists, as stated in the article. They only eat one type of food for it the most part. They're different from a python because as stated in the article a python is a generalist not a specialist.
6390	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because it is a specialist which means that they eat nothing but bamboo or eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. But a koala and a panda are both different from a python is a generalist, which can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica to outer space. They also  do best when around humans.
11574	5	0	they send messages out of the cell.
623	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. First, they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor. Second, in order to make sure their experiment was valid, they could have done another trial and lastly, they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results.
9318	4	1	''Invasive'' is a significant word. In the article they use the word ''invasive'' as passing judgement. For example in paragraph 7, it says ''they're introduced. I think that invasive is passing judgement.'' And ''invasive'' is significant throughout the article because it talks about the python and almost how destructive it can be, but also it can be a good household pet.

5312	3	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because both eat leaves almost exclusively, they're different to pythons because pythons eat anything. According to the text, ''A python swallowed an alligator .'' In other words, pandas and koalas are not something to really worry about unlike pythons.
331	1	0	I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
285	1	1	In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.

14841	6	0	There are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane. One of these ways is that treh cell forms itself around treh substance and then closes in, with treh cell membrane moving around it, therefore positioning it inside treh cell. Another way is that treh cell 'opens up' when treh substance or substances come in contact and then 'closing' after it reaches across treh cell membrane. Another way is that treh cell would move to it, and then absorbs it, in a way of speech.
21107	8	2	The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
17894	7	2	Rose is optimistic, because she lets Anna believe that she knows that when Paul gets out of college, he will get a job that will put them both trhough college as well.
58	1	2	We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.

He had got kicked out of college becuase he couldn't read. Mr. Leonard had lost all of his scholarships and flucked out. Paul was thinking about that could be him. He was trying to keep this all away from Paul so that he wouldn't start to think that he could also be kicked from school becuase nobody wants a 'runner who cant read'.
3340	2	2	The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used.
27582	10	1	light gray ::  Light gray might affect the inside of the dog house because dark colors attract the sun and you do not want the dog to be too hot. But then you dont want white so the dog is not too cold. So t he average temperature for light gray is a good temperature for an living environment.
9482	4	0	The word invasive is important because, it does a major part in explaining the animals. If you didn't know what the invasive meant you would not understand the significance of the article. You would need to know why pythons are invasive to understand the article.
9180	4	0	"The significance of invasive is that the government doesn't want to ""introduce"" new animals into the country. They don't want this because those animals will gain predators and not be invasive any more."
3410	2	1	In conclusion plastic type D based on our data stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. Type D stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for TI and 12 for T2. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial. Also to average the data out.

Crash Course explains how an American and Russian satellite crashed, resulting in small pieces of debris. Little Bits, but a Big Deal explains that objects in free-orbit is an important matter. This set-up provides background information for the readers to clarify the theme.
23073	9	2	In the introduction the author gives a scenario to attract the reader's attention where he/she then explains the scenario and it's significance in the article thus giving a topic sentence where in the following few paragraphs explains the origination and history of 'space junk' where the narrator then states the harmful effects of space junk and then explains why space junk is so harmful, and finally the conclusion states some ways that NASA and other space agencies are trying to solve this problem.

26745	10	2	black :: If it is cold outside and there is still some sun, the color would absorb the sun, making the dog house a little warme r for the dog to stay in. Giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing. Brandi and Jerry did an experiment wh ere they tested colors (black, dark gray, light gray &amp; white) and bla ck had an average of 53 degrees C. While comparing to the white which was 42 degrees C, that is 12 degrees apart from the black.

867	1	1	When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.

5798	3	0	Panda's and koalas are very similar because they eat every kind of animal. The only thing the panda doesn't eat is bamboo the story says. The pythons just roams around in bushes, cars anywhere but it can't take the cold. It ate a alligator one time and blew up.
5002	3	2	The pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because both species live in only one area around the world. Also both just eat one type off food like bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. But both pandas and koalas are different than the python because a python can eat many foods and live in different areas around the world.
5735	3	0	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are different from pythons because they are specialists, while pythons are generalists. According too RobRoy MacInnes, specialists favor stability and generalists favor change.

26695	10	2	white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white. The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42(DEG)C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(DEG)C .

After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used

Mr.Leonard tries to help Paul become a better student and suceeds. In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he'll be able to read.
20067	8	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a hurdle runner.  In fact he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and borke many of records.  After hearing this Paul wanted to help train him with his reading.

He found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that Mr. Leonard broke records.  Mr. Leonard then tells him, 'I was a good athlete...but not a good student.  We had no learning centers in our school.  I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'  It turns out that just like Paul, Mr. Leonard is a talented athlete, but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read.  Luckily, Paul does have those resources and talent, so hopefully he can make it farther than Mr. Leonard.

11945	5	3	In protein synthesis, after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm.  It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied.  Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome. It attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons. THe tRNA the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which attaches to the amino acid on the tRNA behind it.  Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon, the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond.

3828	2	2	A conclusion I can make is trial plastic type D is the most stretchable and type A is the least stretchable. The student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and trials. Also, the student could have indicated and used a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic.

She shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her. She knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister, but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college. That shows me that she is definitaly a hard worker because she is doing it so she can go on and work even harder to get to where she wants to be in life.

3373	2	1	In conclusion, according to the results of the experiment, On the other hand plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability leaving plastic types C and D somewhere in between them. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be testing each plastic type one or two times for more reliability. On the student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights.
12495	5	1	1. The mRNA goes to a ribosome where protein synthesis will occur.2. The mRNA is read to produce anticodons.3. tRNA brings the anticodons to the ribosome. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid.4. The codons go together to form a polypeptide chain(the protein).

26709	10	2	black :: The color black, might affect the inside of t he doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the o ther colors. I think this because in the data from the experiment, the av erage air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53(DEG)C. The Dark gray lid colors average air temperatu re inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48(DEG)C, the air temperat ure for light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42(DEG)C. Overall, the conclusion you could draw fr om that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors. In the experiment the black lid had a difference in average s from the coldest air temperature (the white lid) by 11(DEG)C.

Once Paul learns that Mr.Leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked Mr.Leonard why? Then Mr.Leonard explains everything. Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.

What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
1138	1	1	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
6673	3	0	Pandas and Koalas are similar to each other because they both are specialist. They really only eat one type of food. Unlike the python who eats more as a variety. A python is a generalist.

Mr. Leonard never gave information out like if he had family or stuff like that he never said nothing about whre he was from or why he was so intrested on Paul. But at the end  he just wanted Paul to be a good person.

23117	9	2	The author organizes the article by splitting it up and putting certain statistics in certain paragraphs so it keeps the reader entertained; wanting to know more. The author starts out the introduction with statements that catch the readers attention, then they talk about everything that has been made recently for observing space, then they talk about all of the collisions that have happened up in space, and then they end the article stating how little things can have a huge impact on earth.

20576	8	1	When Paul knows about the background information about Mr. Leonard he identifies him self on what he says because Mr. Leonard couldn't read like Paul. But what was different is that the schools before didn't have anything to help students then. What Mr. Leonard is trying to do is to show that he is aforcanet for having a learning center that can help many students know then what they had then.
20123	8	1	He relixes that he was a great at the hurdels. Soon Paul relizes that Mr. Leonard was a Track and Feild star back in collage and continues to let him coach to get ready to try out for the team. As Paul confronts Mr Leonard about his past, at first he seems sadened by it. 'I was a good athlete,' 'but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied onfriends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'     'But you went to collage,' Paul said     'Things were different back then,' Mr. Leonard replied. 'The collage scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work ia a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.'     'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' Paul said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
23380	9	2	The author starts the article with an attention getter. He has a strong start the pulls you in by saying something that seems rediculous, but then goes on to say it actually could happen. He continues the article by describing how space junk got into space and what it is. Then he begins explaining how it is a bad thing that it is there. Finally he concludes by saying that the space junk will continue to increase until a solution is found.
20742	8	0	The effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner. Also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write.

398	1	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the containers for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes.
18122	7	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conersation with Anna is, that she is sincere and cares about her. I think this because she asks Anna if she is feeling okay, and tells her the truth about why their dad had to go away. And later after Anna left, Rose went in her bedroom to check on her, but Anna had already fell asleep.
5150	3	1	Koala & panda are similar both are animals & are forms of bears and panda eat bamboo & koala eats eucalyptus which is almost exclusively. Their different from pythons because thier not reptiles & eat leaves and grown stuff instead of meat or flesh.
9326	4	1	I believe that describing these animals as invasive is very fitting their characteristics. These animals have invaded the everglades and its surrounding areas when there are repponts of the animals under the hood of a tourists col then the animal is definitly invasive.
24087	9	2	The author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk, what is space junk?, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal.
18113	7	0	Rose is respectful. She doesn't want to hurt her aunts feelings by telling her the truth that she feels to weighed down by the responsability she has for the family.
1492	1	3	In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
17105	7	1	A trait that describes Rose would be responsible. An example of how Rose is a responsible young lady is because during her conversation with her aunt she doesnt respond when her aunt asks her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' She does not answer because she knows that she has to help out in order for her family to be able to survive.
6166	3	1	"Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they favor one food such as the panda favoring and eating ""almost nothing"" but bamboo. They are both different from pythons because pythons will eat anything which can be proved when in a python swallowed an aligator. This moves pandas and koalas different from a python because they only eat one thing."
24079	9	2	They talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space. They give an example about when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite inter outerspace.     Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.      The amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations. They are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space.
1283	1	2	We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples. It would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use. Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
9152	4	1	Invasive means passing judgement and I think it is also unfair. Invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity.
3540	2	2	The conclusion I drew from the data is that plastics B and D most likely have less rigid polymer structous than A and C. The students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and including the exact weight of the weights to use. I think the experiment is pretty valid because there are no obvious errors, but the students could increase the validity by doing more trials.

21651	8	2	The background information that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard is helpful to him because it makes him feel comfortable with Mr. Leonard. Paul feels out of place and sad that he is a poor reader, but since he shares the same characteristic with Mr. Leonard he feels comfortable with him. At the part of the story when Mr. Leonard states 'We had no learning centers in our school.' it makes Paul feel like he can accomplish what Mr. Leonard never had the opportunity to. Also, he feels that he can compensate for Mr. Leonard's training by teaching him to read.

129	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.

20148	8	2	Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had, at one time, run track. This is evident in paragraph 35 line two when Paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also couldn't read. This fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when Paul said, 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles. The final paragraph reads, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'

In 'Crash Course,' the author tells of the dangers of fragments 'free-orbiting satellites' in orbit around Earth. Finally, the author tells how dealing with these satellites is very hard and very important to keeping things the way they have been for quite a long time now: safe.
6209	3	1	A China panda and a Australia koalas are different then a python, because pythons eat anything and everything. But in the article it said ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves.''

21060	8	2	Paul doesn't seemed surprised that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete in track. He's more interested in why Mr. Lenoard never told him about it before. Paul asks Mr. Leonard why he had never said anything before, and Leonard smiles sadly while he remembers the past. It turns out Mr. Leonard wasn't a good reader either, and flunked out of college. Paul has the same feelings and relates to Mr. Lenoard.  Paul then supports him by telling Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'

5860	3	1	China's panda is similar to Australias koala because these two animals are specialist species. These two specific place and only eat one specific food; compared to a python which is a generalist species that can adapt to other ranges throughout the U.S and eat a variety of different foods.
21319	8	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard shows Paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things. Before the background information is given, Paul failed to see the connection that he had with Mr. Leonard. After Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard's past, he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons Mr. Leonard is helping him.

In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
6731	3	0	Both pandas in China and koala in Australia are, they are both specialists. Both live almost exclusively in one place and eat almost one type of food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. These specialist animals differ from a python. A python is a generalist capable of living in many places and eating many foods.
21433	8	2	He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
5016	3	2	Pandas are specialist, meaning they dine on bamboo. Koala's do much of the same thing. They eat only eucalyptus leaves. Both these animals are different from pythons. In the article the author talks about them being generalists, this means the python can live almost anywhere in the world. Pandas and koala's, however, can not.
8913	4	1	The significance to the word invasive is that Biologist are saying that invasive species are major threats to biodiversity. This goes against the whole articles because it's about how people should own reptiles as long as they have a license.

3851	2	2	Based on the student's results, it can be concluded that plastic type A stretched the most and has the most stretchability. However, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to make all the plastic types the same initial length, and then to record how much they stretched. This would make the experiment more valid. Secondly, they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results.
21183	8	1	Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading.
3567	2	1	I would say that plastic type B is the most  stretchable type of plastic because in test 1 and 2 it doubled plastic types A and C.
3206	2	2	Each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters, as where type D did not stretch much, therefore the type D plastic was the strongest.^p Two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial, do it three times instead of two, and include the length from floor to table.

Both of these animals are different from pythons because these animals do not eat other animals including their own species according to the article. The python is more likely to eat its own species while pandas and koalas do not.
8983	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that the article states that many invasive species undergo a lag before proliferating, for example by 2002 pythons were seen in multiple locations in remote regions of the overglades."
21006	8	2	I think that Paul really relates to Mr. Leonards background information, because he couldn't read back when he was a kid and neither can Paul. That is why Mr. Leonard took Paul to do hurdles because it will help him feel more accepted and he will know that he is good at something, just like Mr. Leonard.

5828	3	1	Panda's in China are similar to koala in Australia because they both are herbivores. Both pandas an koalas are also in the bear family. They are both different from pythons because pythons eat other animals raw and are carnivors. In paragraph 13 and 14 it explained how a python ate a alligator and in paragraph 21 it shows how pandas and koalas are similar.
5307	3	0	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both considered specialists compared to the pythons who is a generalist.

24372	9	2	This article is very well organized. In the introduction the author hooks us with interesting statements, then following that he organizes the information he is trying to tell us into little sections. These include; What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. By doing this he can clearly seperate his ideas, and also by reading the titles we can get an idea about what information we might find in those sections. One specific example is under the section titled 'What Is Space Junk' the author answers just that question. Also, if someone is looking for specific information, due to the way this article is organized it would be more easy to locate.I think this was a very smart move in making a not-so-interesting topic, at least for me personally, relatable and easy to read.

What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
8435	4	1	Invasive is to to be wide spread and escape in a mass area. For example, in the teat pythons escaped because of the hurricane in 1992 and the following years they have been seen in many other different locations.
4935	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are their specialist. Pythons are generalists which are the complete offer, to pandas and koalas. The text states ''a generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white-tailed deer. A specialists is China's panda or Australia' koala.'' The specialists are the peaceful creatures that keep to themselves and generalists are the destructive creatures that are harmful and dangerous. This is just like a house cat compared to lion or a dog compared to wolf.
1525	1	3	I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
3840	2	2	My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy. In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy would be plastic type A. In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12. I order of the stretchiest would be B, D, C, and A. They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails.

In the article says that ""China's panda which eats nothing but bamboo"" or ""Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves leaves almost exclusively"" Pythons are very different from pandas and koalas because pythons eat animals and pandas and koalas eat leaves for example the python ""swallow a alligator."""
3733	2	2	In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.

3044	2	2	A conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type B stretched the most because it is thin and that type A streched the least because it is the thickest. A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics. Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
20682	8	2	The highschool trach coach handed Paul a URL for the internet to visit.  Paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to Mr. Leonard.  The URL happened to be about Mr. Leonard's past.  He happened to be a record breaking track star as a freshman, but then he flunked out of college.  This forms a unique bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard because they both struggle with school and reading.  At the end, Paul says, 'It's time to start your training'(paragraph 46).  This shows that Paul is grateful for Mr. Leonard coaching him and bringing joy to an area of his life he had yet to feel.  In return, Paul is willing to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.

Mr Leonard responded with, ' Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn'y matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder then high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No nother school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' So in the end Paul had realized Mr. Leonard had changed his life so it was time to change his. Paul took him to class and said, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'

26696	10	2	black ::  This color (black) will help the dog house stay/become warmer. Since the dog house is outside, and for the most part its pretty cold outside, the dog house should be black, so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm. Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius. So this proves that the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb, making the object warmer.

24075	9	1	The author organizes the article by talking about a certain subject, but then hinting to another subject. This hint gives the reader a sense of knowing what is coming up. For instance, in the introduction she mentions space junk, but then she moves into another paragraph explaining what it is. At the end of that paragraph she mentions it 'circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit'. This led into the 'Crash Course' paragraph and so on.
3202	2	3	a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.

Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
6014	3	2	Pandas and koalas are both described in this article as ''specialist'' species meaning they need very specific aspects of their lives to be fulfilled in order to survive. An example of this is the panda eating nothing but bamboo. Both the panda and koalas differ from pythons because pythons are ''generalists'', not ''specialist''. Pythons can live in a wider variety of places and eat a vast selection of  prey, where as the panda and koala cannot.

As said in paragraph 21, pandas and koalas are specialist. This contrast with the python which is a generalist and can adapt to different food sources in the area.
3745	2	1	From the student, I can draw the conclusion that plastic types D has the least amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch at all ). The student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it. They could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch,as well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics.

In terms of stretchability plastic B is the most and A is the least. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length.

I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
21023	8	2	In the story, the reader is told of Mr. Leonard's achievements in track and his failures as a student. It is said that although he was able to win and set records nationally, he wasnt able to pursue this track career because he couldn't maintain his grades. Through learning this, Paul is able to empathize. He can relate to Mr. Leonard's struggles and take that to know that he was not just the child with a learning disability, but also the child with potential in his seemingly-dissapointing life.

Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.

11780	5	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it meets up with a RNA polymerase which begins to read the sequence at a start codon. As it reads the mRNA codons and tRNA begin bringing amino acids as they are called for by the mRNA. These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA. Once it reaches the stop codon, it stops and the new protein made of all te amino acids is taken away.
23483	9	2	The author seperates the topics of discussion with pargraph titles such as What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. Each of these titles informs you about what your going to be reading about in the pargraph below.
23942	9	2	In this article, the author organizes the paragraphs into an introduction mentioning space junk (with humor), a paragraph explaining what space junk is, specific details about crashes that bring to light what COULD happen in the future, a section describing the harmful effects of tiny debris, and finally a paragraph that explains how the effects are increasing and how nations are working together to come up with a 'viable solution to space polllution.' This organization technique is common in information essays. First, the problem is introduced, and from there the problem is discussed with background information, statistics, comparisons, analogies, and inferences. For example, the author uses the comparison of sand 'shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall' in the section that describes the harmful effects of small debris.

24275	9	2	The author begins with an introduction intended to catch the reader's attention.  He then explores the topic in more detail, using three different sections.  The first one, entitled 'What is Space Junk?' explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth.  The next section, 'Crash Course,' describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide.  Finally, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains why space junk is a problem  and why it is important to find a solution.

It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics. ^p The student could have specified what weight to use, so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight. Different weights would affect accuracy negatively. The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested. For example, if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly. The student could make sure each test was in same environment.

The effect the background information has on Paul, encourages Paul to continue to practice track and field, and to try his hardest in school. Aftering hearing about Mr. Leonard's experience of being a freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, and who had broke records, and asking what had happened effected Paul the most. Also after hearing that Mr. Leonard had fluncked out of college after his freshman year because he had to rely on his friends to get him through school, it encouraged Paul to study his hardest and in his tutoring class, so that he could be a track allstar some day in college, but to be able to handle the rigorous school work that comes with college.

15251	6	3	Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

27490	10	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker th e lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the bl ack lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temp erature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute tr ials was 42 degrees. Because black was the darkest color of the lid, it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest (and vice versa for the white lid.) Thus, because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated, the best color to paint it would be white because white would absor b the least heat.

In Brandy and Jerry's experiment the white lid was the coldest, and they said dark colors absor b more heat, so white would be an appropriate color.
23595	9	1	The author organizes this artilce by seperating it into three differnt parts. The first part is the introduction , intoducing wht the article will be about. The second goes back to give us some backround information about whaat has been going on. The third is to talk about how serious the matter is that they are dealing with, and to help people understand what's going on now.
5864	3	1	Pandas are similar to Koalas because they are both specialists. They only live in one part of the world and eats only one type of food. They are different from pythons because, as the article says, Pythons can survive in many habitats, unlike Pythons, Pandas and koalas can only live in one place.
23742	9	1	Having four sections in the article all talking about interesting facts from past experiences or problems with atmospheric conditions helps the reader stay interested.
5139	3	0	They are similar because they each eat plants from the enviroment like the panda eats nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves exclusivly. They are both different from pythons because they don't eat other species.
724	1	0	They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
11487	5	0	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, the mRNA takes coded instructions to the nuclues. After that, the instructons are used to assemble the amino acids to the ribosomes. This is taken by the tRNA. The rRNA completes the assembly. Finally, the new strains of ribosomes can be used, finishing protein synthesis.
26871	10	2	dark gray ::  I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside, than if it was a lighter or darker color. I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53(DEG), dark grey was the second warmest at 48(DEG), light grey was next at 45(DEG), and white was least warmest at 42(DEG).

11261	5	0	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the nucleus disappears. This stage is also called Prophase. The next step is when the rRNA takes the ribosomes to the golgi bodies to be 'packages' and send throughout the body to help in certain spots. The third stage is when tRNA is placed together to help make more ribosomes.
27038	10	2	black :: The black paint will make the dog house warme r for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat, wit h the highest average temperature (53(DEG)C).
9443	4	1	Invasive Species, are species that are shipped over and make a whole new home in a whole different habitat. they happen to multiply like crazy in a place with a lot of people and endangers our well being.
3995	2	3	Based on the students data,Plastic A was streched the least at an average of 11mm. Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m. After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm. The student could have improved the experimental design and its validity by doing a 3rd trial also the student could have stated whether or not the plastics started off at a constant length for all u.

Paul then understood that when the classes became to hard to Mr. Leonard and he flunked out that Paul was just like him. Paul is determained to get Mr. Leonard back out and training because he feels as if Mr. Leonard has lost hope.
18338	7	2	Rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunt's feelings. In the conversation they had at the end of the story Rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed by helping the family. Rose didn't answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings.
18298	7	1	One trait that can be identiried based on the conversations between Rose and her Aunt Kolab is that Rose understands and knows she needs to help out her family. She feels guilty for not wanting to help out. When her aunt asked Rose wether or not she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help their family, Rose didn't answer because she did feel weighted down, she just wanted to do what was right. By that particular converstation a reader can see that Rose is respectful and only wants to do whats right to help her family.
9218	4	1	"The word ""Invasive"" in this article means a growing number of (on this case) pythons. The first few paragraphs state how then different species population have a rapid increase. The article says how those invasive species are such a ""major threat to biodiversity."" This because many of these animals rebuild the wild."
3218	2	2	Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.

17033	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring. When Rose is talking to Aunt Kolab she doesn't tell her the truth because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. This shows that Rose is a caring person.
18428	7	2	One trait that describes Rose is understanding.  When Anna says that 'It seems like he's (Papa) been gone for years' Rose understands it is for their good because ' The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he is making here.'

This means they need to live a specific environment and eat specific things in order to survive. As opposed to the python which a ""generalist"" and can more easily adapt to the environment is it in to survive. The article states that the world favors generalist rather than specialists."
18443	7	0	She is very self-sufficient. While conversing with Aunt Kolab, she was very weary about letting her true feeling show. Aunt Kolab thought up the meaning of Rose's dream and asked if Rose felt that way. Of course Rose, not wanting any help or pity, avoided expressing her true emotions.
1290	1	2	I would need to know how to measure I samples. i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade.
8308	4	1	The significance of the word ''invasive'' is like dangerous or agressive animals. I know this because in the story it says ''Biologists, however they say that invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to bioversity'' which kinda mean that the animals in that species are dangerous.
6202	3	1	"Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia both are considered to be specialists which more they rely on certain food and do not like change. 'What favors specialists in stability."" Pythons on the other hand are generalists which means they can adapt rather quickly and live in most different locations. Pythons can adapt to change unlike pandas and of Koalas."
2813	2	1	In conclusion, based on the students data collected, plastic type B was the farthest stretched. One way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used. Another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics.
8570	4	0	The term invasive means invade as in desturb.

26423	10	2	white :: It is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb. The doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table. By doing so, you can see that White had the lowest a verage temperature at 42(DEG)C, while the Black had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG)C. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse.
23458	9	1	The author organizes this article by having sub-articles in the article and having good information in each section.
9484	4	1	"The root of the word 'invasive' comes from the word ""invade"", generally meaning to take over something. Throughout this article, invasive is used to describe reptiles in a negative light. For example, biologists claims invasive species are major threats to biodiversity, because they invade other animals' habitats. They pose as a threat. P^ The word invasive is mainly describing pythons and the threats they cause as when they take over other areas."

9304	4	1	The word invasive is used in the article one man's pet, another's invasive species. I feel the words signifiance in the article is that you either think the pythons are an invasive species or not. Some people say that invasive species are a threat to nature and others say that the word invasive is an unfair term.
3741	2	1	Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
5788	3	1	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are both bears, they both are specialist, and they both focus on eating one food' panda's is bamboo, as koala's is eucalyptus. The panda bear and koala bear both differs from the cobra because the cobra's a generalist as the panda bear and koala bear is not.

23309	9	2	The author organizes the article in sub-headdings. This way seperates information into an easy to understand way so it is easy to find certain pieces of information. Such as in the sub-headding of 'Crash Course', it talks about our satellites colliding with Russia.
6447	3	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are: what the article calls specialists. They can only live in Certain environments and unable to survive in others, pythons are what is called generalists. They are able to survive in different climates to adapt to places in different regions.
3277	2	2	Most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer, one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I think this data is wrong. When you tape the plastic, tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final result. They should also put a certain amount of weights.
8902	4	1	The word invasive is important to know. This is because it is seen all through the article. An example is when they say these is a trade in nonnative creastures a factor is a rise of invasive species, so you need to understand this word to understand the purpose of the article and what they are saying.

Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right.
27317	10	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot while it's inside. White would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color. I know this because in the experiment, the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was less than any other colored lid.

23671	9	2	The author organizes the article ina very logical way. They start out with a kind of story to grab the readers attention, and when their attention is directed to that certain point, the author starts to explain it. The author startes with how people began getting into space, and how space junk ends up in orbit, and ends that section by telling how satelites that malfunctions or breaks goes on an uncontrolled orbit. the next section explains the results when two such uncontrolled satelites collide, explaining that they create millions of tiny pieces of space junk. They end the article then explaining why the pieces of space jusnk, which are so small, actually make a difference.

This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials.
2884	2	2	Plastic type A was the stretchiest. The student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation, and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment.
1545	1	2	Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers.I would also need to know what is the ML size of the identical beaker of size altered or not. The

He obeys the comands form his hall monitor, but there was no relationship formed. When Mr.Leonard introduces himself as a concerned adult, Paul still looks up to him. After a relationship is formed with common character traits, and the two characters become on the same level of understanding.
3918	2	0	Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic.

5741	3	2	China's panda is considered a specialist because all it does is eat bamboo. Because of its lack of variety of food it is similar to koalas who only eat a specific leaf called eucalyptus leaves. Pythons on the other hand move around land and populate in different spots as well as eat a variety of different foods. They eat; just about any meat they can find or fit in their mouths.
3539	2	2	1) Based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample A is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic B is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm, andon the second trial was 23mm. ^P B) The students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins, and increasing the number of trials with each samples.

20037	8	1	Readers can see that the backround information on Mr.Leonard makes Paul realize that he needs to keep up with his grades as well. Mr.Leonards story may help Paul realize that it doesn't matter if you're the best at the sport, because he also has to keep up good grades to get into a college for the sport he's very good at. So the effect Mr.leonard has with his backround information could be considered inspiration.

They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists, as shown in paragraph 20. They can adapt to different foods and can therefore survive in many places and species are quietly.
23020	9	2	In the introduction, the author grabs the reader by making surprising statements. He then however changes to a more serios tone to let the reader know that space junk is a significant matter. He explains 'what is space junk' by reviewing the history of satellite orbitals and explaining how pieces of satellites have broken off and gone into orbitals. He then explains how satellites crash and how debris is broken off. Finally, he explains the importance of space trash and finding a solution to the problem.

Paul then deliberates that because Leanord is helping him at track he will help leanord read.
18664	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is a grateful person. When Aunt Kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell, Rose felt better. In Crossing Over, it says, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.' That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out.
8566	4	1	Invasive means something is introduced or entered an unknown habitat or area. This relates to the shares like phytons and pandas that have ended up in the Everglades because of natural disasters or even people. Invasive explains what and who the snakes are to the Everglade environment along with many species that are introduced to the area.
8090	4	1	The significance of the word invasive is to explain that the animal is invading our home land and people that the animal poses a threat in the article they say that reptiles are invasive species but MacInnes says that government overestimate the threat of these species some are cammercially attractive.

214	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container.

21276	8	2	The effect that has on Paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.  Paul understands how Mr. Leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading.  The fact of how Mr. Leonard explains how hard it was to accomplish homework made Paul feel a connection of similar problems.  That's because Paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done.  Plus this makes Paul understand how he could turn out if he didnt learn adequate reading skills to not flunk out like Mr. Leonard.

6597	3	2	Pandas in China eat only bamboo and koalas feed exclusively on eucalyptus trees in Australia. Both are specialists because they can only survive on one type of food. Pythons are generalists in contrast, because they can adapt to different food sources depending on their environment. The panda and koala are specialists while the pythons are generalists.
6428	3	1	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar in that they both are specialists. China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo, and Australia's koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They live by stability. These two are different then the python, because the python is a generalists. It does not live a stable life.

5286	3	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because both these species greatly rely on their habitat for survival. like the article stated , these animals survive due t o a single food source, which is only abundant where they live. This is unlike the pythons, who can move due with what they have for example, Pythons in the everglades have been known to eat species that only live there, like the key Lorez wood rat and once in a while, even an alligator.
9102	4	1	"''Invasive"" is the word to depict the nature of the beast that pythons are deadly animals and that all these reptiles aren't the normal household pets, that people find placing in their yards.

At 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type D's 20mm average.Types A and C were less stretchable than type B by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials. This way the averages would be closer to what they should be. The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights. 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.

14933	6	2	Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.
15472	6	2	The first process is possessing a passive transport. This allows certain substances to pass through the membrane without using energy and others are stopped. The second process is osmosis. This is the transfer of water through the cell membrane. The Third process is facilitated diffusion in which energy is used to move molecules across the membrane.

In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.

21653	8	1	The back ground information that is told about Mr. Leonard brings intrested and excitment to the story. Knowning that Mr. Leonard went through the same thing Paul is going through makes you think that maybe Paul would be able to be succesful like he was. The fact that Paul isn't able to read and neither could Mr. Leonard when he was Pauls age shows that they have something in common.
1444	1	3	To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.

3280	2	3	Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.

Osmosis occurs when water and other materials move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Active transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using the cell's energy. Facilitated transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using a mixture of energy from the cell and energy from the products.

17255	7	2	One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings.
18110	7	0	The first trait that I think of when I read this conversation is how caring Rose is. She has a lot of responsiblilities with her school work and her job. Although she seems very tied up all the time, she still finds the time to ask her sister how she is doing, and try to comfort her with her problems, while also encountering her own. We can tell right away that Anna is very upset, but Rose is acting very mature, and tries to help her in any way so that she will feel a little more relaxed. In conclusion, I feel that Rose was very caring. A person that can endure all of the responsiblilities that she has, and still be as caring as she is shows us one of her greatest traits, caring.

As the article states in paragraph 11, the snakes have imperiled 5 endangered species in the Florida keys. Once they went native, they didn't go back. Causing tennoil in balanced environments it makes sense they've been dubbed ""invasive""."

The author then goes on to give background information about how alot of the debris gets into orbit. In the next section section the author describes what happens to the debris when it is outer space and how it can pose major problems. Finally the author explains the threat of the debris to humans and what is being done to counteract the space pollution.
3613	2	3	A) Based on the students data I can draw the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic B was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics. B) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment.

Paul is the same way when Mr. Leonard found out he Paul couldn't read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read. Mr. Leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life.
3809	2	1	To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
23028	9	1	The author organizes the article in sections.  The sections help place specific topics into categories.  This allows the reader to fully understand what the author wants the reader to know.  The author creates four sections.  Each section has a different topic all under the same subject.  These topics provide a wide range of information about space junk.  The author also organizes the first section with a light conversation.  Then the author gradually becomes more serious by talking about the history of space junk.

6650	3	1	Pandas and koalas are specialist animals. Specialist animals are animal that need a specific enviroment to survive. For example pandas and koalas eat almost only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. Pythons are generalist species meaning they thrive on change. They can potentially live anywhere from humid Florida, to arid Lexas to busy California to even cold Delaware.

One way the student could have improved the experiment could be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the experiment. Another way they could improve the experiment is to add a specific amount of weights in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic.
6700	3	0	Pandas are similar to koalas because both animals need to live in the wilderness due to the things that they eat. Panda's need to eat bamboo and koalas need to eat eucalyptus leaves.

20278	8	2	Throughout the story 'Gifts', Paul is a middle schooler who is in a remedial reading program at his school's Learning Center. Every week, Paul passes Mr. Leonard, a hall monitor, on his way to remediation. Every week, Mr. Leonard asked the same question - 'Where are you going?'. When Paul reveals to Mr. Leonard that he cannot read, Mr. Leonard is empathetic at first, asking Paul to meet him after school. Paul complies and meets Mr. Leonard in the gym, where a basketball team is playing. After they go out onto the track. Mr. Leonard makes Paul run laps, while hurdling. It is later revealed that Mr. Leonard was a high school national hurdling champion, who recieved a scholarship for his hurdling. However, Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldn't read. Learning this makes Paul feel connected to Mr. Leonard, through his feelings of mutual embarrassment and learning disability, and decided to train Mr. Leonard to read, as he taught Paul how to hurdle.
6771	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Austraila because both basically live off of the same things, panda eats bamboo and koala eats nothing but eucalyputus leaves, plants and leaves. Both are different from pythons because it adapts to different food sources. Pythons eats other animals like reptiles.
5856	3	2	Pandas in China are very similar to koalas in Australia because panda bears eat's nothing but bamboo, and koala bears eat eucalyptus . They are both different from pythons because pythons can swallow an alligator.
27245	10	2	light gray ::  This color might affect the dog house because in the summer, when it's really hot, the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black, it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there. Also, the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time, the temperature will be really cold, but it would be dark enough to keep warm. So in conclusion, light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the experiment, the average for the light grey was 45(DEG) C and the average for the black w as 53(DEG) C. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So durin g the summer, the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house. If they had a light grey house, they would have a nice cool house to lou nge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winte r as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .

Plastic type B is the most durable type of plastic because in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm, which was the most amount of stretching. The students could have improved their experimental design by stating how much weight they used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they were using for each trial. Secondly instead of adding weight to the clamp, the should have just put the weight onto the plastic itself to get maximum stretch.

In paragraph one, the author began by commanding the reader to do multiple unique things.  On top of that, the author also asked a rhetoric question in paragraph two with a bit of humor mixed in.  The body of this article has a more serious tone by providing facts and history about satellites and how they become space junk.  In paragraph four, sentance one, the author explains how 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the the first artificial satellite.'  The conclusion of this article is paragraph 11, where the author clearly restates his point of writing the article.  In sentance one and two of paragraph 11, the author proclaims, 'Yet the problem is certain to persist. In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing becaus e commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.'

This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."
9345	4	1	The significance of the word invasive is a passing judgement stated in the article. Invasive means that it's a major threat towards biodiversity. That they are natural predators.
24635	9	1	He makes it organized by telling the reader information they will need to read the next section.
5334	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koala's in Australia because they both eat one specific food that their habitat has. On the story it said pandas eat bamboo while koala's eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons can't eat only one thing and they are generalists.

910	1	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
6439	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both exclusive to the place they live. You won't find pandas anywhere but China, same with koalas in Australia. This is different from pythons because the article said pythons can live anywhere from California to Delaware , any place with a climate similar to their original Asian habitat.

9388	4	1	The word ''invasive'' is significant to the article because it implys the reptiles are invading and not welcome. In the article, MacInnes describes the term as a ''passing judgement'' and calls them introduced. These terms differences express the obvious alterine stand points on the issue of whatever or not reptiles should be spreading.
26449	10	1	black :: Black would affect the air temperature in the dog house. In the experiment the black lid color had on average of 53(DEG) C. This color would greatly effect the dog house in the summer. On hot days, the black color would attract heat, which would be a health issue for the dog.

20566	8	1	I believe it gave Paul a sense of respect for Mr. Leonard and courage to continue what he is doing. Since Mr. Leonard went through the same problems as Paul did and still went to college, I believe Paul gained respect since the hurdle Mr. Leonard went over must have been difficult. He also must have gained courage since if one person could do it, he can do it as well.
27278	10	1	white ::  the dog house will be coller in the sun becau se the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black .
3887	2	3	A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.

2815	2	2	Based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch. Plastic type D must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm. The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used. Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different. Also, in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut.

1262	1	1	To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
21442	8	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.

6253	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists because they unlike generalists have to live in one place to survive, and eat one specifically based diet. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, they do best around humans. And eat a variety of things not just one.
23796	9	2	The author organizes the article into three sections, following the introduction. These are titled 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. These sections help separate the different types of facts and make the article easier to read.

6548	3	0	"A panda is similar to koalas because they each eat only one type of food. ""The animals pandas which eat almost nothing but bamboo or Australia kola bear which eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". The reason they differ from a python because pythons they eat only animals. This is why I think all these animals differ."
21109	8	1	The reader and Paul share the same mind frame. It states in the article, 'NO other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' They are both very dedicated to their athletics, however, when you cannot make grades you have to sarafice the things you love for the things you will need to know in the future. In the article it states 'I know them well...I didn't know the answer everyone else knew.' When it comes to education they are both slow at comphrending and understanding what the other students catch onto quicker.
2806	2	1	a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
6290	3	1	A python is a generalist. It is easier for them to survive because how we live suits them better than the specialist. They ate China's panda and Australia's koala bear. They are both endangered species. They eat certain things that only grows where they live.
9805	4	1	"The word invasive shows that pythons, rattlesnakes and other reptiles weren't originally and naturally found in the United States.

20137	8	1	The information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul greatly. Paul now has to goals to strive for, hurdles and reading. Mr Leonard's personal feats will push Paul harder and further to reach his goals.
8430	4	2	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that when people think something is invasive, it shouldn't belong. MacInnes says that using the word ""invasive"" is unfair to pythons & other reptiles because he thinks they're just being introduced. This suggests people don't want to be introduced to something different."
23040	9	2	The author organizes the article by breaking it down into sections and talking about different things in those sections, like What is Space Junk? and Crash Course.
999	1	2	They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.

20176	8	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard is impowering for Paul in specific ways. Paul had no idea about Mr. Leonard because a Track and Feild star, but he listened to him anyways, when the coach gave him the URL to look him up he was surpirsed. When he confronted Mr. Leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce. He wondered what happened, why he hadn't done it since he won the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman. Paul could really relate his story to Mr. Leonard because he as well couldn't read. Unlike Mr. Leonard, he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read. When Mr. Leonard was done explaining his story he thought since he help him that he would help him learn how to read. The background information help him connect with Mr. Leonard on a whole new level.

Pandas + koalas are cute and fluffy + pleasing to the eye. Pythons are scary and slimey and people are affraid to even go near them.
1148	1	3	The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.

231	1	2	One piece of information I would need to know in order to replicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar-filled container. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results.
3121	2	2	My conclusion from the data presented is plastic type B and C through B and C increased higher but D stays constant at 20, those were only with two trials the student should have done more trials and should have stated the length of the paper.
6267	3	2	"Pandas and koalas are similar because they both are specialists. The panda and the koala eats only a certain type of food rather than everything. A pand eats, ""almost nothing but bamboo,"" and a koala "" eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. However, in the article, it implies that pythons eats almost anything from the tmiest thing like a worse to an alligator. Also pythons like these in Asia are design in about a third of other states in the U.S with similar climates unlike bears & pandas that are stable."
8081	4	1	"Invasive means something that invades an area. This is important in the article because the main idea is that pythons are an "" invasive"" species in the Everglades in Florida. without understanding the word invasive, one would not understand the arguements presented by Bob Roy MacInnes or skip show on the positive or negative affects of pythons as invasive species."

3398	2	3	Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces.
20593	8	1	It inspires Paul to let Mr. Leonard help him keep becoming a better athlete.
8726	4	1	"Invasive is used as a negative thing in this article. For example, MacInnes who is for the reptiles living in homes says "" even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, I think that ""invasive"" is passing judgement"". The animals are looked at as monsters and seem invasive to Snow who think the animals are rediclals."
3550	2	2	It seems that plastic type B is the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges I would mark would be more trials and more test plastics.
627	1	3	To replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.This would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. Say what sample to use in the experiment too.

Paul could tell that when Mr. Leonard told him what happen to him in college he was embarassed just like he was when he was chosen to read something aloud and didn't know the answer. He feels grateful that Mr. Leonard had given up his time to help him excel at something. Then Paul felt that he had to help him out.

6391	3	0	The way pandas and koalas are similar is that they both only eat one type of food. In the article it says, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively. The way these two animals are different from a python is that pythons eat a lot more different food because they're in so many different environments.
24639	9	1	The author organizes the article by the importance of the text.For one the first paragraph (What is space Junk?)is a pretty serious matter.Then after that text is still important but the way the article is set up,is like the paragraphs are organized based on the importance of the information in them.

20253	8	2	The effect it had on Paul was that he didn't understand it, thats why he says to Mr. Leonard 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' And Mr. Leonard tells him about being a star athlete 'but not a good student.' And explains that he couldn't read just like Paul.And I think Paul could relate to that and apply it to his own situation.
23347	9	2	The author uses a hook to get the reader interested.  Then they tell about what space junk actually is for people who don't know.  They also tell how that space junk is created.  Finally, in the section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' they emphasize that even though most space junk is only tiny peices, it is a serious problem and can cause a lot of issues.

The author then explains what space junk is and how it got there to give us some backround information. In the Crash Course topic, the author states that not just outer space crashes create debris, but random small objects too. In Little Bits, But a Big Deal, the author elaborates on why we should be concerned. One reason we should be concerned is the space debris can crash into our working sattelites and disable them.     The author ends with an outro paragragh stating that the problem is increasing, but there are people looking for a cheap and easy way to solve the space debris problem.
9601	4	1	The significant of the word invasive to the rest of the article is important because it is a comparison between two people. One person states that the species an invasive because species move around but not quite as fast and are major threats to biodiversity. The other person argues that it is a wonderful introduction.

She feels an obligation to work, yet she does not like it.  Her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what [she's] doing to help this family.'  She suppresses her answer, which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes.  Once her aunt offers to help support the family, Rose feels 'lighter.'  Her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible.

This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.

Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.

Now he sees something totally new, a new insight to Mr. Leonard's ideology, a new perspective from the man who got him started doing hurdles. The narrator's shock flows out of him when he asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him about his past. Then when Mr. Leonard explains why he dropped out of school, Paul is bewildered, but this gives him a new drive to do well in the learning center. This also gives him the idea of getting Mr. Leonard some help with the learning center. The information about his past spurs all of the reader's actions in the sequence of events that make up the falling action and resolution.

This is different from pythons in that they can survive almost anywhere. You take a panda away from the bamboo in China it won't live. Same goes for the koalas in Australia, but you could bring a python anywhere and it could still survive.
9545	4	1	Invasive means invading. An invasive species is a species of animals that changes their location to another. This word is significant to the story because the story is about how pythons are moving locations.

6803	3	2	Pandas and Koalas are similar because they are both specialists- they eat only a specific type of food and so can only survive in a specific habitat. Pythons are generalists- they can eat many things and so can  live many places. This makes them a very effective invasive species, as described in the article.
5080	3	2	The similarity between panda bears from China and koala bears from Australia is the two species eat mainly one or a few things. Panda's eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus tree leaves. These animals differ from pythons because this harmful animal will eat anything that is meat, and can survive with the changes in its own diet.
15477	6	2	Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration.  Active transport is also used.  ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane.  ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient.  Protein carriers also control movement of substances.  Protein carriers go through a distinct process to engulf the substance and then release it back in or out of the cell.  All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane.

Also in the conversation with her aunt she wants to do something to help people see some thing from their country of Cambodia. Things like sewing some things for women from there or make special treats.
5610	3	1	Since both pandas and koalas are vegitarians and are specialists, who according to the story need stability they are very similar. The author means that since the earth is rapidly changing koalas and pandas will if not already become extinct. Pythons can cooperate with change, especially since they are meat eaters. As long as they have more than one source of food their existence will be longer than koalas or pandas.
17996	7	2	I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage. Though she was troubled by how her life had been, upon talking to her Aunt she felt a lighthearted peace within herself. She knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened.

They are both different from a python because a python can live where ever and pandas and koalas can't without assistance.
15114	6	1	The membrane surface in a cell is referred to as being 'semi-permeable.' This means that only certain things are capable of entering the cell. Therefore, the membrane would regulate what enters or leaves the cell. With these particular processes happening, the travel of substances across the cell membrane would be limited.

1022	1	2	To replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers, there needs to be a control, and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved.
325	1	3	To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
8508	4	1	"The world ""invasive"" describes that something is invading & causing harm. The article is trying to disprove that reptiles are invasive."
472	1	2	Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.

3565	2	2	a. The purpose of this lab is to test 4 different types of polymers to see which polymer is the stretchiest. Based on the results founded, it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest. In both trial one and trial 2, plastic B stretched the most with 22mm in Ti and 23mm in T2 plastic type A was the least stretchable with T1 and 12mm in T2.^p b. One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test. Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time. This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time.
15363	6	0	The cell necluous sends information to the other cells to move the whole organism.
4059	2	3	Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
5981	3	2	Koalas are similar to pandas because they are both specialists meaning they need a specific diet and would not last long in other parts of the world. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and can live in a multitude of places.

'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' is what went through his mind. This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
2873	2	2	From the data given to me, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding. Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity. A second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment.

After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray, dark gray, or black lidded jars. With a starting temprature of 24(DEG)C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42(DEG)C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53(DEG) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11(DEG) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid. Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me.
26518	10	1	light gray :: I chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter.

20868	8	2	I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher. Little did Paul know, but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner. This background information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him. This also makes him want to help with his reading problems. At the end of the story Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
26396	10	2	white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house. White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day. When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53(DEG)C. When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42(DEG)C. This is a difference o f 11(DEG)C. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day.
26421	10	1	light gray :: light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot b ut not to cold
18394	7	1	One way to describe Rose would be respectful, because through out the whole story Rose never talks back to Aunt Kolab.
20555	8	1	Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Paul is also excited about his newly found knowledge of Mr. Leonard. He felt like he knew what Mr. Leonard felt. The embarrassment shows they are a lot alike.
1106	1	1	In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
24017	9	1	The author makes subtitles that lets the reader know what the paragraph is about.
20571	8	2	The effect of Paul about the background information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul and Mr. Leonard is almost alike because Mr. Leonard and Paul can't read and they both have run track in high school. Paul is willing to hepl Mr.Leonaard with his problem.

The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes.
20924	8	2	Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul. He was once a young boy, and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have.      As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning. To this day, as he is telling the story to Paul, he is still unable to read. It is obvious that Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul, and show him that he can pass school, if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated. Paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that, but it only made Paul want to try harder to acheive his grades, and go to college.

Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
5703	3	1	Pandas in China are different from koalas in Australia because they live in different places as well as how their diets are different. they are both different from pythons because they are specialists and pythons are generalists.

956	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
2894	2	2	Based on the data, one can conclude that polymer B is the stretchiest and polymer A is the least stretchy. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the test with different amounts of weight that way several stretchability of the bags could be tested. Also, the students could have conducted more trials. The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident.
428	1	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
715	1	2	Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?

14633	6	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are sodium-potassium pumps, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Sodium-potassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane. Endocytosis is a process in which a group of phospholipids surrounds a substance outside of the cell in a circle and carries it in to the cell. Exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead.
6285	3	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both walk on legs they both eat bamboo and leaves. They are different from pythons because pandas or koalas can't slither on the groun and they can eat a crocodile.
174	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.

12711	5	0	Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are messaging RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfering RNA, and protein production.mRNA attaches to a section of a chromosome, and then it copies the amino acid code that makes up the chromosome. Next, the mRNA messages the rRNA to copy this section of the chromosome into an anticodon which is an exact reflection of the original code. The rRNA has the tRNA transfer this code into a set code for a new protein. Finally, protein production occurs where the protein is synthesized to match the original code for the DNA.

24176	9	1	The author organized the article by havinf four different things about space and naming each paragraph with a different title.
27035	10	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay.
20890	8	0	Paul was a guy who felt neglected and was always picked last and Mr. Leonard picked up on it.  He knows what it is like to feel embarrassed to not be able to do something because he flunked out of college.  He motivated Paul to do hurdles and showed him how they are obstacles in life. He also found that he was not good at reading either so he was concerned and wanted to help.
24355	9	1	The author organizes the article by splitting up the diffrent sections of the diffrent serious matters. There's the space junk, and the reasons for it being there, and how unnecessary it is.
11282	5	0	The first step involved with protien synthesis is activation. mRNA must activate the hormone that starts replication. The second step is the hormone Helicase dividing the two strands of DNA to be read. The third step is replication. DNA Polymerase replicates the DNA by matching the codons with the anti-codon, making RNA. The forth and final step is 're-zipping' the DNA strand into one, uninteruppted strand.
9774	4	1	"Invasive has a great significance in the article. It's basically what the article is centered around. As certain species like the python have been ""invading"" areas like the Everglades, the article says that they have been killing many endangered species. The article is primarily about the controversial issue of whether to allow reptiles as pets, as they could easily ""invade"" the surrounding environment."
6493	3	1	Panda's are similar to Koala's in Australia. These not so much similar just different but their different because, they both eat different foods and one can travel from Florida to Antortic and from there to outer space they both different from a phython because their not visiouse animals.
332	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.

24699	9	2	The author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections. The first section is called Orbiting Junk. The second is called What is space junk? The third is called Crash course. The fourth is called Little Bits, but a Big Deal. They break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article. So its not all in one combination.
22998	9	2	The author starts off with a piece of space junk in the air. Then he explains space elxploration, then talks about satellites and finally explains the danger of space junk.
366	1	2	Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams.
24415	9	1	He talks about the 'Orbiting Junk', and how it goes around the earth. He talks about 'what is space junk', and how much trash there is in space. He talks about 'Crash Course' and how there is almost always crashes in space. Then he talks about 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', and how much trash goes into space.
15615	6	0	They control the flow of the substances.
681	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, the group's procedure should include more specific information. They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples. They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled. This will make the procedure easier to follow. It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers.
1121	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment.

5124	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia and are different from pythons because the pandas and koalas are specialist, but the pythons are generalist. An example from the article states ''a python can live anywhere. China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.'' This shows that the python is different because it can live anywhere but not the panda and koala.

5198	3	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are specialists. Pandas eat nothing but bamboo and they really couldn't live anywhere else, same with koalas; it eats only eucalyptus leaves. Specialists like the panda and koala cant servive everywhere. However pythons are generalists, ""with the assistance of technology they can live anywhere around the world"" - they are very differant from specialists."
1064	1	0	First additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3. Then after step 6, find the difference in mass of each sample. The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples.
2839	2	1	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that the amount each plastic type stretched at consistent rate during both trials. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight was being added to the plastic samples. They could've the validity of the experiment by trying different amounts of weight with each plastic sample.
26055	10	1	light gray :: They would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool. The tests showed that Dark or Light gray is ab out 46.5(DEG)C so it will be good for the dog.
17903	7	1	Rose is hard-working, the story told how she went from school to her job and then home to work some more. She's constantly busy and doesn't complain much, a good trait to acquire.
219	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.

3841	2	1	In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time. Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic.
24670	9	2	The author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine. It includes headings with short paragraghes under them. The point of the article is made very clear in a short amount of space with many imperative facts and details. They make it interesting by giving each heading an apealing name such as 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
8915	4	2	The word invasive pertains to the rest of the article in that it is describing the animals. The term invasive is just saying how the animals forced out and go to new places and live there. Then they disrupt what is already there so essentially invasive is just saying how the animals came in and try to take over the habitat by eating and force.
9174	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" in this article means life taking over, beginning out. The word is significant because they are  talking  about how this reptiles are being invasive around the world."
2964	2	1	a) Two out of the four plastic types lengths increased. ^p b) First  the students should have more trials and allow the weights to hang more than five minutes on to the clamp.

21709	8	1	When the reader gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, he understands that Mr. Leonard was in the same situation as him. Mr. Leonard was a good runner, and he couldn't read very well just like the reader. But the reader was getting help and Mr. Leonard didn't want the reader to end up like he did, flunking off because he couldn't read. It would be a waste of potential.
9574	4	1	"From facts and how they use the word in the article, I think the word ""invasive species"" is like another word for dangerous or like its trying to take over the environment. I say this because its kind of like the word ""Invade""."
12442	5	0	One step is mRNA being remembered.Second step is the proteins being made.Third step is the proteins being released.Fourth Step is the proteins being used as energy.
9340	4	2	The word invasive is used to describe the pythons since they were introduced into a different habitat and are endangering other animals such as the key largo wood rat. Also, they say that scientists aren't happy with people who are introducing invasive species to their habitats because they might decrease biodiversity.
17434	7	1	Rose tries to put things lightly so that she wont hurt others feelings. This becomes apparent when she is talking to Anna about their father and trying to comfort Anna.

10999	5	0	The first major step involved in protein synthesis is mRNA leaving the nucleus. When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the amino acid sequence back to the protein which then results in the second major step which is passive transport. Passive transport brings proteins in and out of the cell. The third step is the when the mitocondria is making its way to help out the other cells with the protein synthesis. The last step is when the protein is making its way back to where is suppost to go, resulting in protein synthesis.
26924	10	1	black :: The color will affect how warm or cold the do g house is . Because the white would be 42(DEG) and black would be 53(DEG) .
14658	6	0	The ER, that makes protein. The RNA, that packages the proteins, and messanger R that delivers the packaged protein.
26057	10	2	white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat, so the dog wont be as hot. If Brandi an d Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ((DEG)C) was 54, in trial two its ((DEG) C) were 52, in trial 3 its ((DEG)C) were 54 and the average is 53. So these re sults show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not mak e the dog comfortable with all the heat. While the white lid in the exper iment had very low temperatures its ((DEG)C) were 42,43,41 and its avera ge came to 42 ((DEG)C) so this shows that the white will absorb barley a ny heat.
27247	10	1	white :: white color will give back the sunlight, it m ake the doghouse will not get too much hot.
22975	9	1	The author organizes the article in parts. He starts with an introduction to pull the reader in and then quickly changes the tone to show that he is still taking the article seriously.
94	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
23682	9	2	The author at first gives you some background information on the space race between Russia and the United States.He then talks about how the satellites that were launched need repaired or sometimes crash into each other which is a cause of the 'space junk.' The author then ends the article by telling us the danger and damage this little fragments can cause.
5899	3	1	"The pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because according to the article paragraph 21-23 it explains how pandas only eats bamboo, and koala bear eats eucalyptus they leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from the pythons because according to paragraph 11-13 they said that ""pythons were seen in multiple locations in remote regions of the everglades; they eat anything and they get used to the environment. That is why panda and koala are extinct."
26446	10	1	light gray ::  i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm, and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray.
22972	9	2	First, the author gives a quick explanation of how space junk is created in the passage 'What Is Space Junk'. Here, they explain that when satellites malfunction, they become high-tech junk. In the next article 'Crash Course', the author tells a story of a U.S. and Russian satellites colliding, creating many debris. Finally, the author explains the importance and dangers of space junk in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. In this article he explains that even though some debris are smaller than a baseball, they pose a serious threat to spacecraft or astronauts.
21614	8	2	The background information that Paul recieves connects with him. Mr. Leonard was fanstatic at hurdles in college and was going to go very far in that world. he was shut out because he couldn't read. Paul is learning that he is the same way and he is starting to become a great hurdler and is getting better in reading. He realizes that after all that Mr. Leonard trained him to do he should help him in return.

24187	9	2	First the author starts out very enthusiastic and wanting to actually tell you about the topic he wants to express. The author uses a very catchy introduction and it really got me hooked from the first time i read it. Then he gets serious and starts telling about how 'space junk' is really a harmfull thing and we are under estimating what it can do. Then he starts talking about crash course which tells you how people cant control dead satellites but they are still a major threat.
20617	8	2	Mr. Leonard couldn't read either and he couldn't get very far in his life. So the narrator has to try harder to accomplish his goals.
21328	8	2	During the story, Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a college hurdler. Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well. He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard. After all, Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles. Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
261	1	0	You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
5645	3	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because both are because both are exclusive to their own habitats, and both animals have strict dids. They are different from pythons because pythons live in many places, and they eat a large variety of food. An example of this was when the python ate the alligator.
8407	4	1	"The word invasive is significant in the rest of the article because it explains why animals like pythons and other reptiles are causing problems. An invasive species is an animal who is not native to an area so they are ""major threats to biodiversity"" according to some biologists. The word invasive explains why there is a debate between scientists and people like RobRow MacInnes."
905	1	2	Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
5431	3	1	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the pandas only eat one bamboo and the koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, but the pythons are very different because they eat anything, the pythons have eaten a wood rat and tried to eat an alligator but the python exploded. I know this because it was said in the article in paragraph 21 about the China pandas and the Australian kola bears and paragraph 11 and 14 about the pythons. This means that the pandas and kola bears are not harmful but the pythons is harmful.
190	1	2	Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.

20392	8	2	At first Paul was a little shocked that Mr. Leonard had not told him about his successes as a runner. The author tells us that Mr. Leonard smiled sadly after realizing what it was. Mr. Leonard then went on to explain the whole situation and this inspired Paul. After their conversation about Mr. Leonard's past, Paul decides to encourage the both of them to begin training together as stated by the final sentence; 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' i said, walking back to the school. 'It's time to start your training.'

When he is done telling us about the history, he then begins to tell us facts and statistics about the revelations that scientists and astronauts have concluded throughout the years.
18535	7	2	There are many traits that describe Rose. One of these traits is she has never complained about helping to pay for Paul's college education. One detail that supprots this trait is when she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' Rose is willing to work for her family because that is tradition that occurs in Cambodia.
6773	3	1	China's panda, as well as Australia's koala are specialists. They both are set on a certain type of food. Furthermore, the panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala bear eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves. However, both are different from pythons because they can be in multiple locations and are generalists.
23430	9	2	He first starts out with an introduction. Then he talks about how the space invasion took place. He then talks about space debris from old satellites. Finally, He talks about the importance of keeping space clean.
3636	2	1	The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.

Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
5867	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because the article states that ''China'' pandas which eats almost nothing but bamboo and koala bears which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively. Therefor they only eat the vegetation things while pythons are meat eater for example a python swallowed the alligator.
5333	3	2	Koalas and pandas are similar because they both only eat one type of food which is native to were they live, but pythons can adapt to different food sources making it easier for them to find food and survive.

20115	8	2	Learning about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in many ways. When he realizes that Mr. Leonard was a successfull hurdeler, he feels proud and surprised that Mr. Leonard would take the time to help Paul succeed. When Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard's struggle to learn, Paul feels a connection with him. He understands how Mr. Lownard felt and after hearing his story, he knows that he wants to do well in school. Before he didn't realize how much not being able to read could effect your future. Learning Mr. Leonard's background information helped Paul be even more determined to succeed.
23658	9	0	The author gives us details about the space.

5709	3	0	Pandas in China are harmless because their main food source is bamboo and koalas in Australia have one main food source as well. The pythons just go for anything and are more hostile than the panda or koala because they have recorded a snake swallowed an alligator whole, says the article.
27238	10	2	white ::  If the color is a dark color then the tempera ture will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade. White was t he color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and th at would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature.
1076	1	2	"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."

The author then moves into the history of space junk, and how pieces of junk came to be orbiting the earth. It starts out sayaing, 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.' The facts that the author gives explain how the problem came to be, and gives a brief history of space exploration. The author then moves on to describing the risk of satellites colliding into one another and gives examples of such times. He also explains how other debris is created. The article reads, 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russion, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hous, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' The historical story he uses helps to prove his points. The end of the article is the persuasive part, telling why all of the facts he has shown us are significant and why space pollution is undeniably a big deal. The article reads, 'Yet the problem is certain to persist. In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.' The persuasive techniques he uses leaves us concerned and wondering about how space pollution could affect us.

8871	4	0	The snakes are invasive because there moving from there own habitats to ones and there not reproducing and it is basically killing out the pythons.
5439	3	1	In the article it says that panda bears mostly eat bamboo and Koala's mainly eat eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because they only eat o certain amount of food while snakes any pythons eat a lot of different things. The article even said that a python tried to eat an alligator.
8972	4	1	The word invasive is important because it describes how the pythons are moving around the U.S. They are just going everywhere they can, we don't want them to but they do eather way.
4962	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both a specialists who need very specific environments to survive. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists that can live close to almost anywhere.
17314	7	0	One trait that can descibe Rose is exhausted.she is exhausted because of everything that she must do for herself and the family. She must work at a restaurant after school and then go strait home to make supper and she still has homework to do. Rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework.

26096	10	2	white ::  According to the reults, the lighter the colo r, the colder the temperature is. Since white had less heat, they would w ant to paint the dog house white.
17366	7	2	In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, we can see that Rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell Rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings.
621	1	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the students are looking for? Why each steps of the procedure is being done? Why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions , in order to create more accurate data.
26540	10	2	white :: White might make the doghouse cooler beacuse white, in the experiment, showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees C. When black increased by 30 or so degrees C.
8882	4	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive""to the rest of the article is that they are calling them dangerous animals. But all of the animals aren't dangerous. It says in the article that ""Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair."
4014	2	2	A) In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm, while plastic A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p B) The student could have known the weight of the clamps, and add that on to the amount of weight added. Also, they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic.
5464	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they have one food in their entire diet and they're different from pythons because python can find food be it anything from a house cat to a dear.
8079	4	1	"Invasive, meaning a foreign species that has made a home somewhere it isn't native to. For an example, in the article they speaks of how the Nile nonnter lead. can now be found around cape soral.

11875	5	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it arrives a a ribosome where it is turned in to tRNA. Then ammino acid prduction begins and segments of the tRNA are copied to produce them.
6553	3	0	Panda's and koalas are both specialist species, meaning they don't change, but are stable. Pythons are generalists species meaning they are able to change and adapt easily. This is how pandas/koalas, a pythons are different.
18751	7	1	I think that Rose stands her grounds. She is very real about what she says and I think she really means it. She also has her own opinion on things, but she is very caring and I think she really loves her sister.
15403	6	0	The cell wall has evolved over time in organisms to control movement of substances both in and out of cells.  This includes not allowing in germs or harmful bacteria, as well as putting them out, and allowing in things needed for cell function.  Also, the lysosome in a cell removes unwanted or dead proteins from a cell.  The cell membrane is a third regulatory structure of the cell, used much like the cell wall.
26783	10	1	white :: The color white may affect the dog house beca use during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun. Making the dog house less hot.

By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
822	1	2	In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
27233	10	2	light gray :: Light Gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral.
26457	10	1	dark gray ::  It makes the house pretty hot so the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will get too warm
27003	10	1	white :: This might affect the inside of the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun, white would bring a minimum amount of heat.
27104	10	2	white :: the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool, as shown in the table from the sc enario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature o f 42(DEG) compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average tempera ture of 53(DEG).

8923	4	1	The word invasive in this article, is used in a negative manner to show that these reptiles are dangerous and scary..''the threat imposed by invasive reptiles.'' In this quote, he is saying that these dangerous reptiles are taking over because of their rapid reproduction. The word invasive shows that their reproduction is massive and dangerous.
18509	7	1	Rose is determined in the story because in the conversation with Anna, Rose explains to Anna how their situation is going to get better, and she says it with confidence.
20552	8	0	Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college. But they found out that he could not read. So he lost his scholarship and he flucked out of college. They did not wanted a kid that could not read. Mr. Leonard did not wanted Paul to be like him so he told him all about his pass so he could get his grades up and go to college.
20412	8	2	It gave Paul the bright idea to help Mr. Leonard read. It also made Paul wanna start reading so he dont have to go down the same path Mr. Leonard did.
26671	10	2	black :: if they painted the doghouse black, then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb. example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar.
12692	5	0	The tRNA is broken down into genetic code so that other RNA strands can read it and react to it.
26295	10	1	black ::  black because then in the winter when its get s cold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it sli ghtly warmer
9739	4	2	The word ''invasive'' is used to describe the reptiles many times throughout the article. ''Invasive refers to the way the reptiles are showing up all over, breeding rapidly and consuming many of an area's native animals. The snakes and lizards are thought to be able to completely take over the ecosystem in some areas so people feel as though their areas are being invaded by the creatures scientists say they're 'major threats to biodiversity.'

3228	2	1	From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
8434	4	1	The significance of the word invasive is that it is what the pythons in Florida are referred to as. The pythons in the Everglades are a recent adaption for everyone and everything. They are considered ''invasive'' because they have come into the habitats and have been eating the animals that are needed for the ecosystem to survive, they have eaten some endangered species.
27254	10	2	dark gray :: It will be warm inside the doghouse, but not too warm. The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm. I t hought it might be too hot for the dog.

3779	2	2	a) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not. Plastic type A stretched at an average of 11mm while type B stretched an average of 22.5mm.^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use.
3126	2	3	Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
3391	2	2	Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more. This student could have supposed this experiment by adding a third trial for more accurat data and by adding the original length of each peice of plastic to table that he  made. The original length would better the understanding of the data by whoever is reading the table because they would be able to see what length the plastic started at.

24562	9	2	The author first explains to us what space junk is consisted of.  The paragrapghs explain where the debris comes froms and how it got to be there.  The next section of the text tells how the debris crashes into each other.  The author gives an example of when one American and Russian satellites ran into each other.  No matter the size of the debris, the speed can cause serious damage.  The conclusion says that space junk is increasing because of more exploration.
8156	4	1	Many people argue that pythons or other erotic animals are invasive. Scientist who disagree use the word to refute the ideas of the people who ''overestimate the threat posed by invasive reptiles.'' RobRay MacInnes argues that calling reptiles invasive species is ''passing judgement.'' Not all reptiles can be thought of in the same way.
27200	10	2	white ::  if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42(DEG)c for white,unlike the black were tha t is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53(DEG)c. if they wa nt cool for the doghouse then use the white.
26766	10	1	dark gray :: Using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors. The do ghouse temperature would be warm, which is good for the winter and most s easons.

20922	8	2	It shows Paul that school is important. There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
5514	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they survive eating only one kind of plant, (bamboo for pandas, eucalyptus for koalas). While pythons can eat different kinds of animals and survive in different environments.
6284	3	0	Pandas are similar to Koalas in Australia because they each eat one specific food and they are both considered a specialist according to paragraph 21. They are both different from pythons because a python is a generalist and they don't need such a specific thing like pandas and koala according to paragraph 13.
23521	9	2	The author organizes the article in four sections. First, he starts with the introduction. His introduction catches the reader's eye, and provokes him to want to continue reading. Then, he defines what he is going to talk about; space junk. After that, he talks about the dangers of space junk through facts, stories, and examples about satellite crashes and space junk debris. Finally, the author concludes his article in a way which leaves the reader wanting to do something to stop the production of space junk.
2796	2	2	Material type A stretched the least, and material type B stretched the most. Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A. A few ways the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results.

17451	7	1	Rose is a very determined person. You can tell this from the story, because she is working hard in the resturant, making dinner for her family at home, and writing an essay to try to get a college scholarship all at the same time. By reading conversations she had with her Aunt Kolab you can tell she is a very determined and hardworking person. Aunt Kolab says , 'Do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family?' also shows that Rose is a very determined person.
3866	2	2	A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials.

24332	9	2	The author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk. The first section describes what space junk is, and what happens to it. The second section describes how some of the trash is generated, through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag. The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations. The debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous.
5850	3	2	Pandas in China and koalas from Australia are similar because they are specialist and only eat exclusive things like, bamboo or for a koala eucalyptus trees. These animals differ from pythons because they are generalist species that have become more abaunt and do better around humans.

9109	4	1	The term invasive is describing the pythons. Since they are proliferating around the U S. People are describing them as invasive. They are intruding on the land of other animals because they are not native to that area. Invasive is used as a negative look upon what is happening with the pythons.
17352	7	0	Rose feels overworked and wants an easier life. This based on when Aunt Kolab asked her if it's difficult for her to imagine life in Cambodia.
26294	10	1	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm.
27299	10	2	white :: White might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do. Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42.
305	1	2	The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
23185	9	2	The author organizes the aritcle to explain everything in order. The article starts off with the introduction, then to the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?', to explain what the introduction was about.     The next section is 'Crash Course' because the last part of the previous section talked about satellites loosing control, and going into orbit. So 'Crash Course' talks about what can happen when satellites go into orbit.     After 'Crash Course', the next section is titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This is next because it talks about what can happen when two satellites crash into each other which was talked about in the last article.     The author organizes the article like this to make the reader understand without getting confused.

12007	5	3	mRNA leaves the nucleasmRNA codes for tRNAamino acids on tRNA bond to form a chain of amino acidsthe chain of amino acids folds into a protein.mRNA leaves the nucleas after being copied from DNA.  This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, the mRNA is run through, and tRNA with anticodons on one end attach to the mRNA.Each tRNA particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon.  When two tRNA particles connect to the mRNA at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of tRNA can disconnect.  As this process continues, the amino acids begin to form a chain.Once the strand of mRNA contains a stop codon and tRNA reaches it, the final amino acid will bond to the chain.  Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA, the strand folds up into a specific protein.

3101	2	3	a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
2971	2	1	a) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1. ^p b) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others.

23310	9	1	The author organizes the article with several sub-sections, with a length of about one to two pargraphs. This simplifies the material in the article making it easier to read. Also, the sections themselves are about different subjects, but share common points and topics within that tie together as the story continues and creates understanding of the main issue, that being, space junk and it's danger.
21664	8	1	Paul feels bad for him and wants to make him happy by saying the statement in the last paragraph.
6583	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because, they are both specialists. They both eat a specific thing. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves while on the other hand a python also known as a generalist, eats just about anything. and can adapt. If you put a panda somewhere there weren't bamboo then it would probably die but if put a python anywhere it would probably survive.
3754	2	2	The plastic type B had stretched the most. To improve this lab, they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand.

9559	4	0	The word invasive is significant to the article because in paragraph 21, it shows that the word's unfair and that reaserchens have it wrong.
19965	8	2	In knowing Mr. Leonard's background information, Paul feels like the two can relate now. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his inability to read, Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This statement supports the fact that Paul feels empathy for Mr. Leonard because the two of them have experienced the same struggle in school.
3132	2	3	a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
5718	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists, which mainly only eat a main plant. A koala and panda ar different from a pytho because it is a generalist and it eats many things.
27325	10	2	white :: They might use white because it doesnt get ho t as fast as the other colors do.

For all the other colors the trials got highe r than 43(DEG) C therefore , the white would be best for a dog house bec ause it doesnt get as hot.
9229	4	1	The significance of the word invasive is how it's used on species. An invasive species is a species that comes from an area to another and inhabits it. Some harmless species are being stop by the gavament from coming to America.
17898	7	2	A trait that can desciribe Rose would be that she is very sincere. When she was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to answer the quetion that her aunt asked, which was 'Do you feel weighted down by what you're doing to help this family', because Rose did feel weighted down. She did not want to hurt her aunts' feelings by telling her the truth.
5861	3	0	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because both can live off of one thing and only in that area. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koala bears. Those animals differ from pythons because pythons can eat a variety of different animals and can live almost anywhere from Florida to Antarctica.

507	1	2	There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment. Some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be. These would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else, once again there is a risk of the data being invalid.
20158	8	0	The effect that Paul had was consideration more than anything because Mr. Leonard was just a  hallway monitor when he could of been so much more than that. When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard, he wanted to find out why Mr. Leonard 'gave up' on his dream, but he later found out that he flunked out of college. Paul found this out because he look up that URL that the track coach gave him and he asked andpushed the answers to Pauls questions. So he tried to live his dream out on Paul in a way.

Rose tries to get her to see that everything the others in her family are doing is going to help them out in the long run. Rose says 'It's only been four months, He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' When Anna starts to get negative Rose tells her that they have to support their brother, Paul, and he will support them in the future. Rose has a positive attitude.

6337	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialist species. This is because they both survive off if one type of food and live off of stability. A python is a generalist species because it can live anywhere and adapt to change. Paragraphs 20 and 21 both describe what generalist and specialist species are and explain how they differ.
6228	3	0	They are similar because they eat just one food exclusively. Pythons, on the other hand, will eat almost anything to survive. One example would be when the python ate a crocodile.

12662	5	0	When mRNA leaves the nucleus, tRNA transfers information to the nucleus and translation occurs. The amino acids are then read and are distributed. Transcription splits the amino acids and rRNA makes the new protein.
14180	6	2	One process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis. Osmosis is the controlled amount of water that goes through the membrane of the cell. Another process is diffusion. Diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane. This monitors the substances that go through the semi-permeable membrane. Only some substances can leave and only some may enter. The third process is the permeability of the cell. The cell is semi-permeable so it will only let in some of the substances that try to enter the cell.

Pandas eat bamboo, while Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Both of these animals are different from pythons because pythons are abundant and will eat anything that they can get their rangs into. They are generalists.
4053	2	3	a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.

College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him. But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read.

Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
195	1	3	After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.

None of the other plastic types stretched as much, Plastic D one the closest at 20mm. b) The student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created, which has the length of each sample at a constant length. Also, he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, not every 5 minutes.
262	1	0	The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers.

If there is a chilly day in the winter, you can put a blanket inside to keep the dog warm, but I would say that altogether, whi te is the best choice.
20273	8	2	Paul was very suprised Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about winning the 400 meters in college and breaking records. Paul realized that when Mr. Leonard talked with him about no being able to read and flunking out that he was embarrased.

After this they tell you about how two satellites crashed into one another causing space debris. After that, they talk about the damage that could be done by the debris and how it can break down other ships and satellites in space. With all that information, they talk about how this problem will worsen and cause more crashes and more debris in the future.

Also pythons are considered to be an ''invasive'' species by some.
9669	4	2	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the rest of the article because it causes the reader to view the situation from the perspective that pythons have a negative impact on native species. MacInnes argues that ""the term ""invasive species"" is unfair"", but Skip Snow disagrees.

Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion.

26195	10	2	white ::  The best answer would be white because white is a light color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer. When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when a jar had a black lid on it, the temperature inside the jar was an a verage of 53(DEG)C. Whereas, when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42(DEG) C. That is an 11(DEG) differance. There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white.

Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
17979	7	0	One of Anna's traits is that she is jealous of Paul because he is in college. She gets mad when other people try to stand up for him. One example is this passage is when Rose told Anna that Paul will get a good job after college and even pay for them to go to college, she just rolled her eyes, pushed the chair aways from the table, and told Rose she sounded just like their mom.
14581	6	3	Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane. The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport, also. During active transport, energy input is needed from ATP to move a substance against its concentration gradient.Cells use endocytosis and exocytosis to move things into and out of the cell. In exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell. In endocytosis, the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material.

23727	9	2	The author organizes this article in a very intelligent way.  First he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction.  Then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs.  The first one is called 'What is Space Junk?' This paragraph defines Space Junk and explains how it is formed. The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course.'  This paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous.  The last paragraph is title 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'  In this paragraph, the author is explaining that even though most of space junk is relativley small, it can still be dangerous at high speeds.

On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.

Both pandas and koalas are specialist animals, this means they have to live in a certain climate and eat certain foods to survive. They differ from pythons because pythons because pythons are generalist animals, which means it has a more general food source. Overall koalas and pandas differ from pythons.
11971	5	1	Four major step are involved whenever the mRNA leaves the nucleus. The first major step is that the mRNA becomes attached to a ribosome. The next step is that the mRNA joins with the tRNA. The third step is that for every three codons the tRNA creat anit-codons. The last step is the making of the amino acids by the tRNA transfering the anti-codons into amino acids, which is needed fpr tje reproduction of DNA.

Pythons are diffrent because they are a generalist species. Generalists favor change unlike the specialist. Also a python is carnivorous and it's died ranges.
8582	4	1	The word ''invasive'' has a lot of significance when it comes to the article. It talks about how many species of animals are being introduced to countries they don't belong at an alarming rate. It means that we as people need to stop it before it gets out of hand.
75	1	1	Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
4924	3	2	Panda's are similar to Koala's by they are both specialist species. They only survive in certain conditions. They are not able to adapt very well and can only eat and live in certain climates. They are both different form pythons by they are not reptiles. Also a python is a generalist specie and can easily adapt to change. They eat a variety of foods, and accept change.
291	1	3	First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
27252	10	1	dark gray :: If they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse, the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog.

The author then talks about satellites and how they can become dead and just float freely in space. The author finishes with telling the reader about objects in space can be very small but still cause massive amounts of damage.
1560	1	3	To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?

11720	5	2	In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. There, a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA. As the ribosome reads the code, tRNA find free amino acids and bring them to the mRNA to be arranged. When they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein.
17385	7	2	One trait that Rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family.  This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up.  Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa.  It seems like he's been gone for years,' (para. 8).  Rose's response is, 'He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here,' (para. 9).  This shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has, she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all.
23969	9	1	The aurther organizes the article by keeping certian articles separated, 'What is Space Junk' deals with the information of space junk like, like information of what happens to all of bits and pieces lost in space.     As for others like Obiting junk just deals with a small novel that gets the readers attention.
18723	7	1	Rose can be described as selfless. She puts the needs of her family first. She risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family.

6536	3	2	"As stated in paragraph 21, both pandas and koalas are known as specialist because they can only exist in a specific area that holds/grows their source of food. While these animals share this lifestyle in common, the python contrasts them. The python, on the other hand, can spread anywhere with a suitable climate, thus making it more of a generalist. Because pythons are often ""around humans"", they are more ""abundant"" than pandas or koalas, as stated in paragraph 20."

By this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone. She doesn't like that she is also so busy but because she is a hard working person, she is making sure she never disapoints her family. She knows they have given so much and continue to work hard so her and her younger sister have an education.
17941	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is an overwhelmed young lady. This is expressed when she says, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' and also when she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'

Paul believes that he can do it because he knows that Mr. Leonard did it in college. Even though Mr. Leonard flunked out in college doesn't make a difference to Paul because Paul believes in himself and believes that he can do this no matter what. Mr. Leonard has taught Paul alot, and Paul is not going to give up on running track. Mr. Leonard could not read when he was in school, just like Paul, but Paul realizes how good of a track runner Mr. Leonard was, and he is pushing himself to be just as good as Mr. Leonard was.

15211	6	3	Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane. It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.

6016	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are born specialists. They both like stability, unlike the python these animals are different than pythons because pythons are generalists. Generalists like change and can live almost everywhere. Specialists such as panda and koala cannot.

He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.

24545	9	2	The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising.

17727	7	1	Based on her conversation with Anna, the reader can conclude that Rose is a strong person. For the sake of her younger sister, she puts on a brave attitude and sincerely assures her sister that all the promblems and conflicts within the family will soon be ressolved. We know that Rose works very hard in everything that she does, mainly for the sake of her family.       In the begining of the story, we read that Rose feels very worried that she won't be able to finish an essay for class, do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family. However, when she is having her conversation with Anna, Rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister. This suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story. I believe that this little action shows that Rose is a strong and hearfelt person.

17295	7	2	One trait that descibes Rose based on the conversation between her and Anna is that she is helpful in many ways. To me it seems that Rose is more of the mother figure in Anna's life and is there for her when she needs something. She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working. An example of the book of how Rose shows this trait is when Anna woke up and came into where Rose was, Rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay.

The author gives the background information that the reader needs, such as 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.' Then in this piece, he/she introduces the problem to readers, revealing that the satellite that malfunctions and cannot be repared, or the satellite that collided with something else 'becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.'      In the second part of the article, 'Crash Course' the author conveys the problem, which is the overall theme of the article.  He/she even gives an example of a time when the problem occured when 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' The author reveals that satellites can actually collide with each other, and cause space debris which can be extremely harmful.     Finally, the author calls the reader to search for a solution to this problem.  He/she conveys to the reader that, 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise' and that scientists need to come up for a solution to this problem before it becomes too large to handle.

20918	8	2	The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard I think has made Paul not be ashamed that he is getting help. Mr. Leonard told Paul 'I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This shows Paul that he should get help with things now, so that in the future he won't rely on other people, like friends, to get him by in college, and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out.

This shows that, at the time, Paul didnt understand why Mr. Leonard didn't pursue track and field. Afterwards, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate. He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle.
11368	5	2	The first big step in protein synthesis is the mRNA leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores. The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA. Next, tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein. The anti-codons are joined by amino acids. To finish the process, a tRNA leaves and the ribosome moves down the mRNA to the next codon. A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon.

While A stretched 2mm and B stretched 1mm and C went from 14mm on T1 and dropped to13mm on T2. ^p The ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight.
21424	8	1	When he learns the background information, Paul realizes that he understands the feelings that Mr. Leonard's words were having. He understood how he was embarrassed that he couldn't read, and that he went after something he could excel at. That's why Paul said he had something he could do for Mr. Leonard.

The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times. The students have to do the procesure, they have to do the experiment like three time as or more. The need to have all the materials and put it in order. The need to have his own question. Find his conclusion.
21223	8	1	The effect this had on Paul was good. He wanted to start to help Mr. Leonard. Paul said that is was time for Mr. Leonard's training. This was a good thing because Mr. Leonard's life is a lot like Pauls, so he feels he can be the same. He knows he should learn to read then he can excel in the hurdles like Mr. Leonard. This had great impact on Paul.
6486	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they don't eat other animals. It said that pandas only eat bamboos and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, unlike the python it eats other animals for example, it said a python ate a crocodile but then explained.
17350	7	1	The one trate I would identify Rose with would be understanding. She shows this trait when she explains to Anna why Papa had to leave.
3880	2	3	From this experiment, I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one. They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic.
2807	2	3	As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.

On the third step another tRNA brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather. And the fourth step is that these steps are repeated and all the amino acids stick together and form a protein until they get to the stop codon.
24345	9	2	The author organizes this article by using different sections. The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The cause for this is to have everything more organized.
6688	3	0	China's panda is similar to the Australian koala because the both only eat one type of food. Pand only eats bamboo, and the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost all the time. Thats why I think they are similar.

Unlike the python, which is a deadly, venerous snake, the panda and koalas are left alone in there habitats, while the viable snakes (python) are brought to the U.S. In the story, it says how the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves, meaning they are herbavores.
20370	8	2	By learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it helps Paul realize that he is not the only one that has problems with reading.  It also taught him that just because you are not good at one, doesn't mean you are bad at everything.  Paul can still succeed and do good in other subjects, like hurdles.
4023	2	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
20432	8	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard helps him relate to Paul. In the story, Paul goes to the learning center to learn how to read better, and later Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard cannot read too well either. This brings a closeness and a sense of empathy to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard is helping him with track, Paul figures that he can return the favor by helping him with the tutoring he never got. This shows how grateful Paul is.
8439	4	1	The word invasive is unfare because it describes the type of species. Multiple time in the article the phrase ''invasive species'' is used. Also, Mac Innes doesn't agree with this term because he feels as if it is unfair. ''They're introduced. I, think that 'invasive' is passing judgement.''

They start out by a story, then it goes into what space junk is, it gradually goes into talking about satellites and the dangers of those, then it starts to talk about how dangerous space junk really is and the fact that nothing is really being done about it. In the last paragraph, I like how it ends with this, it starts talking about how little of a thing can be such a big problem. We are starting to adjust to the space junk, instead of the space junk adjusting to us. We are changing for it instead of getting rid of the space junk.      I like how this article is structured. It gives detail and stories. It is informative as well as interesting. There are always problems in the world, but to know that even the smallest thing can hurt our world is good to know, as well as knowing that nothing is truly be done about it.

3842	2	3	(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
2887	2	1	Two ways tat the student could have improved was to let the weights hang there for a little more time. Also use the same length of plastic for each trial.
5222	3	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because both are specialists.They wouldn't be able to live any place else in the world because of the type of food they eat bamboo and eucalyptus leaves both animals differ from a python because pythons are generalists and can live in many places.

20847	8	2	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has him feeling both appreciative and sympathetic. Paul feels good because he has been coached by a great national winning hurdler. Also Paul felt good about himself because he was asked to pratice with the track team and he was always bad at sports. On the other hand, Paul was sympathetic for Mr. Leonard for what had happened to him. For example Paul asked, ' Well, what happened after that.' That shows he was curious and cared.
20842	8	2	Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative. He not only overcomes his inability to read, but finds an outlet, and takes leadership in both. In running track, he gets on the high school team, and in reading, is able to help Mr. Leonard learn as well.
6221	3	2	Chinas panda and Australias koala bear are both specialist species. Also they both eat basically the same type of food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. These two species differ from a python because a python is a generalist. Also the article said that a python can live anywhere as a panda/koala cant.
3143	2	0	In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.

For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.

A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
24550	9	2	The author organizes the article by first providing an exciting introduction about space junk, then follows it by explaining what space junk is, is the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that, the author tells of a specific event in February 2009 that gives the reader of an event that actually happened, not of one that could or might happen. After that section which was called 'Crash Course', the author goes onto the next section, which was named 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This section tells the reader, in detail, or how dangerous space junk can be. It also explains that NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to come up and with an easy solution. After that, the author finishes up, but without a specific conclusion.

3705	2	3	As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.

This differs from a python which has a broader diet which is why it can survive in more places. I can also tell that a python can eat different things because, swallowed an alligator. Also, the article states, ''you could probaly have pythons snacking up the Pitmeas river.''

This makes them similar but different from pythons because pythons eat other animals unlike koalas & pandas. In the article it says, ""A python swallowed an alligator..."". Pythons would try to eat other animals, that what makes them different."

8490	4	1	"The word 'invasive' in the article gives off a connotation that some species do not necessarily deserve. Not many people are used to seeing reptiles as pets and now that the idea is becoming popular, they refer to lizards and snakes as an invasive species. Achenbach says in paragraph 7 ""...the term invasive species is unfair .I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement"". This word almost forced of bias upon the reader."

If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
24003	9	2	The author begins the article with a kidding tone.  The introduction is not nearly as serious as the rest of the sections.  'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' are all have a much more serious tone.  'What is Space Junk' gives a background of space exprlorations and explains what space junk is.  It also foreshadows the potential problems of space junk by asking 'What happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfunctions.'  'Crash Course describes how space junk came to be and different situations it involves.  Such as colliding satellites.  'Little Bits, But a Big Deal describes other bad situations of space junk and the very serious problems they can cuase.  Problems like 'disastrous holes'.
3641	2	2	A. A conclusion I can draw from this is that plastic type A had stretched 22mm the first trial, and 25mm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type. ^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials. I think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested.

Pandas exclusively eat bamboo while koalas almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. Both the panda from china and the koala from Australia differ from pythons because pythons are generalists who can live pretty much anywhere and survive while koalas and pandas are specialists.
23407	9	2	The author divides the article up into separate sections. Each section has a header indentifying it. For example, the headers 'What Is Space Junk?' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' are used to tell the reader what the following paragraphs will entail. This organizes the article and makes it easy to read as well as easy to go back and find information.

3012	2	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type A was the strongest plastic used. It took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics.

3281	2	0	The conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out. Two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results.
5214	3	1	pandas in china and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists, meaning they generally eat the same thing for every meal.

23611	9	1	The author organizes it by obseving what is happening in space and that things in space travel very fast and are very dangerous. Every once in a while some of the debris will get scattered around and will cause harm to the enviroment. Plus the soviet union was the first to launch an artificail sattelite and the united states followed shortly after.

The author then goes into detail about how the junk actually entered the atmosphere. The section titled 'Crash Course' posses the problems that are radiating out of all the space junk. This includes the problem of satelights running into each other. The author then ends the article explaining how little bits of undetectable debrees can harm space equiptment.
1595	1	1	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
9386	4	2	Invasive species is a species in an area that is not native to the species and could have bad effect on the organisms around it because it has no natural predation, In this article, pythons are the invasive species and they are putting other species in danger of being extinct.
23952	9	2	The organization of the article is simple, yet very effective for the reader to truly understand the concept of space junk. In the beginning with the article called 'Orbiting Junk' the author creates an intresting lead in to draw in the reader. After that paragraph the author proceeds in the body paragraph to tell the leader about space junk and the dangers that causes to other satellites. I especially liked how the author organized the paragraph called 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' I liked this because I had no idea that a tool bag would be such a treat if it was free-floating in space. I like how it discussed the damages it caused by using a metaphor about sand and the dangers it held.     Through this organization of introduction, body, and conclusion, the reader was able to understand how space junk is a serious matter.

22987	9	2	The author organizes the article in sections based on the information found under each heading. The author starts with the simple question 'What Is Space Junk?' to make sure the readers know what the rest of the article will be about. The next two sections are about how Space Junk is made and what it can cause. The order of the information makes sense in the human mind. First, tell us what it is, second, tell us how it is made, and third, tell us what it can do.

He begins with a general definition of space junk in the introduction, to warm up the readers for what is to come. Then, in the next section, he begins to change his tone as he starts the discussion on pollution in space. In Crash Course, he explains that satellites will also collide with each other, and make the problem bigger, becoming even more serious yet in tone. He then concludes with his last section by stating the severity of the subject, and implying that something needs to be done about the problem.

He or she begins with a creative introduction to engage the reader, then proceeds to lead right into the main idea: space junk. He mentions the objects that have been sent into Eath's atmosphere and branches off the problem of satellites, and what happens when it malfunctions. He concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk. This leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that 'dead' satellites cause, and so on. The author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage.

8607	4	1	The word invasive is so significant because while some don't view snakes and reptiles in unnatural habitats, fine and okay, invasive puts a harsher side on it, saying that those animals shouldn't be there and they are ruining the ecosystem.
23546	9	2	The author organizes the article by what the catergories are. He has the introduction and then the first topic he wants to talk about which 'What is Space Junk?'. Then the author has 'Crash Course' another main topic and finally, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', and his conclusion. He makes the topics seperated like this to look almost like a newspapper and to show each is important.

24148	9	2	The author organizes the article into multiple sections divided by headings.  The author does this to help the reader get a better understanding about what he/she is learning about.  First, you learn about the history of space travel.  Then, you are given information on a real collision that occured a couple of years ago.  Following this, the information is then put into perspective by talking about a sandblaster.  Finally, the call to action takes place to conclude this article.

Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
9480	4	2	The word invasive is significant to the rest of the article because it explains that people think these species of reptiles are invading territory where they should not be. Many people believe these species are harmful and are major threats to biodiversity. Pythons and other reptiles can be dangerous, that is why they may be considered harmful.

24414	9	2	The author organizes this article into paragraphs of each topis with a title that sums up the main idea of the paragraph. In the paragraph 'What Is Space Junk' the author talks about the history of space travel and things going and getting stuck in space. 'Crash Course' was given a clever title because it talks about space collisions. And the last paragraph 'Little Bits But a Big Deal' explains why space debris is so important. Do this time of set up is very good to organize the article and make it simple.

He organized it by starting out with what was seen in the sky that you don't see everyday.  He's got different titles which talk about what exactly is in the sky on this earth that we don't normally see such as space junk and what it is.  He then goes into talk about how the space junk causes crashes and the harm that it has.  Then he goes into talking about how even if it's little particles that aren't very big, can still cause serious damage due to the the speed of the spacecraft and what it runs into.

There is an introductory paragraph to get the reader's attention, a section to explain the history of it all, 'What Is Space Junk?,' a section to talk about space collisions, 'Crash Course,' and a section to talk about how dangerous it can actually be even though space exploration is very important, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The author made a good decision by choosing to organize this article this way. It really gets the point across.

20527	8	2	Paul was a poor reader.  Knowing that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college just because he was a bad learner made him realize that they had something in common.  Mr. Leonard worked with Paul to get better at track.  Mr. Leonard told Paul to keep trying and work hard.  Paul hearing this knows now that you have to keep working hard and keep trying to succeed.  Paul knows that Mr. Leonard should keep trying with his grade and in time he will get better.

6554	3	2	China's panda bear is similar to Australia's koala bear because they eat only one type of food so they can only live in areas that support the growth of their food. Unlike the python which can live anywhere that is warm and has small animals.
6245	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koala's in Australia because they are specialist and harmless. In the article it explains that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo while koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves. These specialist differ from a python known as a generalist because pythons are deadly creatures. In 2005 a python had swallowed an alligator.
5583	3	2	Both pandas and koalas are specialist species. According to the articles they each have specific diets. Pandas mostly eat just bamboo, and koalas generally only eat eucalyptus leaves. In contrast, pythons are of a generalist species, since they have a much more varied diet and climate tolerance. As a result, pythons and other generalist species thrive in this day and age.

8559	4	1	The word 'Invasive' is significant because it relates to what they were saying in the article about pythons spreading. For example in the article it says that pythons have been seem in multiple pieces. This shows that they are invasive.
3325	2	3	Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.

3244	2	3	"According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp.

1480	1	3	One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
23926	9	1	The author starts with the history of 'space junk.' It starts with back in the 1950's what happened with this so called space junk. He or she then tells of the dangers of space junk and the harmful things it can do. Lastly, he or she talks about the destruction it caused up in space. Saying that two simple satelites can crash into each other and then form many, many little pieces from that explosion means they can crash more often and cause more danger.

17228	7	0	Rose tries to look at the bright side by telling Anna that everything will be fine but she is actually very worried.
5032	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both require special native food. Pandas eat bamboo which is predominatly found in China. The koala which lives in Australia, only eats eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because they are both specialist animals. They are both different from pythons because whereas the python can survive in the south of of the U.S, the panda and koala need to continue to live where they live now.
804	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in (step 4).
494	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
17585	7	1	Rose is positive and kind. I think she is kind because she tries to make others stay positive and see the glass half full. She tries to make others feel as if they are helping and make them feel strong and good about themselves.

23333	9	1	The way this statement is organized is very well because they start off by getting your attention. Next they start with some basic information that will help you understand what is coming up, then after they hit the hard facts that you should know about 'space junk' like how even the smallest things in space can affect a big space ship with this happening also that we could have satellites crashing into each other and the tiny parts flying into earth. So this article is very organized.

3600	2	0	A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
26410	10	2	light gray :: Light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse. One reason I chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse, the dog could overheat. Also, the opposite is true as well. If you had a white doghouse, it may make the dog very cold. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C, and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)C. This makes a grey-painted doghouse the best choice.

6095	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both mammals. They both eat same kind of plant life and they're both viewed as harmless creatures. Pythons, on the other hand, are reptiles. They are carnivores, they like meat. People see pythons us dangerous, vicious animals.
17644	7	1	Rose is someone that looks out for others and cares more about the good of the group rather than her personal situation.  She likes to put herself in other's shoes to understand what they are going through and how she can help.

On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
5217	3	2	Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because they are specialists. Pandas almost exclusively eat bamboo, while koalas almost exclusively eats eucalyptus leaves. This means that these animals are really only able to live in certain areas, while the generalist python can feed on countless foods and can deal with a fairly large range of temperatures.

23427	9	2	The author starts with the importance of space junk when this person says 'This 'space junk' is currently of great concern to the government space agencies around the globe.' The author proceeds to tell what space junk really is when it says 'What happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfunctions and can't be repaired? The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit.' Then the author tells about what will eventually happen to these satellites while they are going about in space in the crash course paragraph, by saying 'two communications satellites, one American and one Russian, both traveling at more than 20,000 mile per hour, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth. The impact created hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path.' Then the author tells about how these small pieces of debris could cause alot of damage to those traveling in space.

20762	8	2	As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard, he was a hall monitor. This made Paul respectful and obedient to him. That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics. The next peice of backround information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard, is that Mr. Leonard was a track star. This simply increases the respect he has for him. In the story, Paul didn't appear to be upset that Mr. Leonard hadn't told him about his past, he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more. The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he couldn't read. Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate, but Paul can simpathize. He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read.

While Ana believes family should come before work and money.
4998	3	2	Pandas in China, and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are specialists. So they have to stay in specific habitats to survive. Pythons are generalists, they can move anywhere and adapt to their surroundings to survive. In the article it says that the pandas mostly eat bamboo and koalas mostly eat eucalyptus leaves.
6275	3	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both mainly eat one thing. A python differs from these because they eat many different things to survive.
26905	10	2	white :: A white doghouse would absorb less energy, an d its temperature would be cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the li ght, white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest, bla ck lid. A dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperatur e, and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun, and cool in summer.
20048	8	2	The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard made Paul want to try harder to read. Paul knew that he was good at track but not good at school. When he found out that Mr. Leonard was the same way but then got kicked out of track for not being able to read, it made Paul only want to try harder.
5704	3	0	"Chinas panda's and Austraillia's koala's are alike because there both specialist's.

But as for the generalists they can arguably live anywhere."
27293	10	1	light gray :: I think light gray, because from the data tha t was the color that was almost in the middle, so that the dog house woul dn't get too heated in the summmer or spring, and it wouldn't get too col d in the winter or fall.

After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
5405	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both only eat one type of plant. Bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. They are both different from pythons because pythons have a variety of food where ever they go while pandas and koalas can only only live in certain areas that grow these plants.
26929	10	2	light gray :: Light Gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool, but not to cold, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog. The data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45(DEG) C, while the black jar was 53(DEG) C, and the white jar is 42(DEG) C. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog.
687	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure. I would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that I can make sure some of them gets the same amount. Also, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples (by using a balance, or scale, etc). Finally I would need to know if the containers were closed or not, because that environmental factor could change the results of an/my/their experiment.
9330	4	0	Invasive means passing judgement, or unchecked by natural predators. This means the animals are not safe for other people.
6670	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia.They are because they are both specialists who cannot live anywhere. For example, pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and a koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists which are like us humans who can live/adapt anywhere.
1165	1	1	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Tell how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.

11682	5	3	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.

11656	5	0	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus is goes through the blood stream. While in the blood stream once it gets to the other nucleus it drops off the information from the nucleus it just came from. After all that the mRNA is needed no longer. Then comes the tRNA that will help the other nucleus figure out the message. Then it helps the nucleus decode the new message to where it will make sense to the nucleus. Then the rRNA comes along. The rRNA picks up on the new decoded message. Once the rRNA is done getting the message it takes it. The last step would be to take the code and make another RNA sequence.
108	1	3	In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.

3499	2	3	My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.

12321	5	0	After mRNA leaves the nucleus it tells the transport RNA to bring nucleotides to the active site for synthesis.  Proteins and amino acids are also brought to the active site.  The messenger RNA tells the existing proteins how to make the neccessary new protein and synthesis begins. ATP is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction.  The protein is then finished and the messenger RNA notifies the nucleus of the completion.
3783	2	3	Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D,C,A. ^p The student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight. They could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate.

It is plastic type B because it stretches the most out of all the other plastics in both trials.^p (B)One way that you would increase the validity would to measure how much a plastic stretched when you put the clamp on it. Another way to further validity the experiment is to do a lot more trials for more results.
1055	1	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?

17410	7	2	In the passage 'Crossing Over', Rose has many different traits, but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility. When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What's wrong?' This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna. Then when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her lets the reader know that Rose has a big resposibility with the family. When her aunt says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family. The two examples that are given are small but imply much more that, Rose is almost like a second mother for her family.

4064	2	2	A) I have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type A stretched the least amount of millimeters. ^P B) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp.
3343	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
3421	2	2	The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability. According to the data table, plastic type B is higher regarding stretchability having the most mm's  in trial 1(22mm) and trial 2 (23 mm) while the least stretchable is plastic A having 10 mm in trial 1 and 12 mm in trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be by testing not just stretchability but abrasion and other technique, 2) increasing the amount of trial for greater data.
5688	3	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Pandas only eat bamboo, and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons because pythons are generalists, pythons are able to adapt to new environments, such as those of southern USA. Specialists, however, unlike generalists cant adapt to new environments because they rely on something only in their environments.

Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what to measure the length of the plastic with.
3626	2	2	My conclusion is that plastic type A can stretch the least, because not only did it not stretch anymore in T2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most. it stretched 2mm more in T2. ^p (b) One way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.

Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged. Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk. 'Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.'
23804	9	2	The author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention. By then identifying the flying object in the sky as 'a...tool bag,' it makes the reader want to read the article. The author goes on by explaining what the meaning of 'space junk' is and how it gets there followed by what happen to satellites when they 'die.' The author finishes his/her article by notifying the reader that space junk is a big deal and is 'increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations  have undertaken  space exploration.'

12561	5	3	When translation begins, the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon. It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached. The result is the newly created protein.

3478	2	2	A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.

The third section goes into detail about how some of the 'microdebris' came into our orbit and how easy it is to lose somthing in space. Then finaly the last section tells about the dangers and precautions we as a human race are taking to fix this problem, it then concludes the Essay.

27144	10	2	black ::  I chose the paint color black because this co lor would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time. Even on a cloudy or rainy day, Brandi and Jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the s un. After 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid, the air 's average temperature raised 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3(DEG) C. The glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature rai sed only 18(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42(DEG) C. The differ ence between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the blac k lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10(DEG) C. This means tha t the darker the color on an object, the more heat energy the color absor bs, causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it. Therefore, Brandi and Jerry should paint th eir doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the colo r absorbs.
2803	2	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability. Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is. The students could have said what the initial length of the plastic was and keep all the others plastics at the same length because if one plastic was longer than the other the experiment would be valid. And they also say how much the weights that were being used weighed because one could be heavier than the other.
26782	10	2	"white :: The doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table, ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature,"" the glass jar with the white lid was the least affecte d by light. For example, the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42(DEG)C, while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53(DEG) C."

Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters.
24116	9	2	The author organizes the article with an introduction, and three body paragraphs.      Paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion', and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites, telescopes, and space capsules that cannot be repaired.     Paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space, resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites'.     Finally, paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter, stating that at extreme speeds, small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment. A solution is difficult, but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space. It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites, capsules, telescopes etc. being sent into space, and how therefore space trash is increasing.
5986	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Koalas  eat primarily eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat mainly bamboo. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists. They will eat anything from mice to alligators like the article said.

One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."
12755	5	1	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it takes the directions it got from the nucleas to the ribosomes. Then enzymes unzip the DNA so it can be copied. Then the DNA that was made is trasfered by tRNA and he transferes it to RNA so that rRNA can put together the nucleotide sequence to make the protiens.

26310	10	2	white :: i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white. i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy. that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat.
21063	8	2	When Paul first discovers Mr. Leonard's seemingly glorious past, he is puzzled at the notion that Mr. Leonard would keep that information from him. Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard. Upon doing so, he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only Mr. Leonard, but himself too. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading. In fact, Mr. Leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps Paul to identify with him, for he too is plagued with the same problem.     Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive. He feels a reason. He actually begins to feel adequate. Now, with the understanding that he can achieve, he feels reason to pay back the favor. He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well. Without knowing that Mr. Leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics, Paul would have never had made such a life changing change -- realizing his value.

Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.  b) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched. They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
9481	4	1	"The term ""invasive"" is significant to the rest of the article because it summarizes how some people are describing the fact that pythons are expanding where they live. Some say it is bad and invasive, while others say it's a ""wonderful introduction"" and not invasive."
3843	2	1	I think plastic D is the strongest because it's the highest weight and they are both even in trial 1 and 2. ^p The first thing they can change is add a few more trials so they can really see if it stays the same or changes. Another way is to add more weight to each piece of plastics.
21508	8	2	Paul was both surprised and upset about the background information. He was surpised because he thought Mr. Leonard was just an average coach but he found out through the background information that he was wrong. He was upset because he thought Mr. Leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past.
21612	8	2	When the reader finds out about the background infromation about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. When the reader first talks to Mr. Lenoard he says '...you broke records.'(pargraph 38) showing his felling and shock to find out that the person who was coaching him was a record breaker.

3552	2	2	A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely.
1269	1	2	After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing. The three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each, container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object.
21346	8	2	The background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard, helps motivate him.  It might make Paul, really work on his reading.  Even though Paul is still young, his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like Mr. Leonard, and for that he wouldn't want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either.  You can tell by that, from when he tells Mr. Leonard, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time you start your training.'
26779	10	1	white ::  White might be the best color for the doghous e because of its low heat intake. With the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would a lways get hot. So, with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortabl e in a less hot doghouse.

4060	2	1	a.) After testing this experiment, the results show that plastic sample D stretched the most (mm), making it the weakest plastic. Plastic type A appeared to have streched the least amount of mm, making it the strongest plastic. b) The students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group. They could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment.

3717	2	1	A) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials. ^p B) 1.They could of easily measured for more time. This way they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. This way average will be more precise.
20213	8	1	Mr. Leonard's background informatioon gave Paul incouragement to do better and push harder. It also helped Paul to realize that you have to work in school to make the grades that you want. Paul could relate to excatly how Mr Leonard felt. When Paul heard Mr Leonard tell his story he heard the emotion in his voice that was very familiar to him.
6665	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat from some type of plant. In the article it says that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas in Australia eat eucalyptus leaves and these both are produced by a plant. They differ from pythons because they won't adapt as well to a different habitat like a python would. Pythons are like humans and can live almost anywhare, where as a panda or koala bear couldn't.
5707	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists rather than generalists. They also eats from a very specific food source. They are different from pythons because the python can live anywhere in the world. In the article it talks about it living in many different areas but the koala and panda don't have the ability to live anywhere.

24728	9	2	The author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled 'Orbiting Junk' that is used to introduce the subject. The author then uses two sections to explain what 'space junk' is and why it is such a big danger. He then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful.
24461	9	2	The author organizes the article well, by putting information in certain sections. The author for example talks about an American and Russian satellite colliding into each other. The author puts thihs information under a section called Crash Course. The author puts the information, into specificly titled sections, which makes this a very organized passage.
8178	4	1	The word invasive is important to know. This is because it is seen all through the article. An example is when they say these is a trade in nonnative creastures a factor is a rise of invasive species, so you need to understand this word to understand the purpose of the article and what they are saying.
5560	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar by their eating habits. Both species exclusively eat one thing. IN the article it says that pandas, eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Panda and koalas differ from pythons by the pythons is a reptile and the others are mammals. In the passage it states that mammals are warm & fuzzy but snakes keep adapting to different environment.
26958	10	2	black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most. In the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53(DEG)C, the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the glass with the light gray lid was 45(DEG) C and the glass with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This proves that if Brandi an d Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint. Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse.
1218	1	1	For the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup. For each sample I would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sample should be used.

6125	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because, they are specialist organisms. They cannot move from their native land, China an Australia, because they can only live off of that environment's climate and food source. Pythons are different because they are generalists. They are capable of moving around to different environments. Pythons have been seen in many different places.
23146	9	2	The author organizes the article from the basics of space. First , knowing about space junk and how it effects research in space. Second, is what could happen when there is a crash in space and how dangerous it is when dead satellites could risk colliding. Third, how it is a big deal on what is in space and if it falls to the ground. In conclusion, The author is just making it easier to understand.
3156	2	1	A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
8278	4	1	"The word invasive is like invading on one's domain. In this article that word is important there are people who are unhappy with reptiles being moved to America as pets and call them ""invasive"" They believe that the species are intruding on their land and there could be trouble because since they are generalists they can adapt anywhere and become the dominant species."
23374	9	1	The author starts by telling about the sky. Then they tell you about space junk what it is and how it got there. The author tells you everything from the beggining to the end.
6481	3	2	"China's panda ""eats almost nothing but bamboo"" and Australia's koala ""eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" and specialist species because they need certain environments to live.

3769	2	3	Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
3573	2	1	a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.

In paragragp forty-five, Paul states that he understands the emotions that Mr. Leonard felt, and that is why he decides to start training him in reading at the end of the story.
2928	2	3	A conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same , growing , or shortening. The students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials. They also could have been more detailed about how much weight ,they were adding to the plastic.
5847	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both a specialist species. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are generalist. Pythons are more adaptable to change and can live almost anywhere while pandas + koalas are natve.

1477	1	2	After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment.

3514	2	1	The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.

'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer anyone else knew.' This quote from the story shows that Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard, and that it has brought them closer together. Paul also felt the need to help Mr. Leonard with reading, as he had helped Paul with track and field from this quote, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at someting. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
17102	7	2	Many of Rose's traits are displayed throughout the story. One trait that is shown is how she is caring. In the text Rose is worried about hurting her mother or her aunt. Rose feels as if she is being overwhelmed with everything she has to do. This in turn causes her to have a dream of being trapped in the water by her older brother. As she attempts to get out, water fills her mouth and she sinks further down. She decides to tell her aunt of this dream. Her aunt then begins to question her about if she feels weighted down. Rose ignores the question because she doesn't want to hurt her family.

The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out. It takes alot to tell someone what they do not want to hear but it shows that you care for them.
9442	4	1	"In the story MacInnes says "" Even the the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said."" They're ""introduced"" This means that the species considered 'invasive species' is a species that gets introduced to new land by human transportation, unaturally."
6659	3	1	The pandas in China are very similar to Australia's koala bear because they are both specialists. Specialists are species that cannot adapt to change very well. According to the article both the panda and koala live on mainly off one main food source. These two species are very different from pythons, which are generalists. Pythons eat rats and alligators now and can live in a large variety of climates,which is unlike koala & pandas.

Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.

With the black lid color, the temperature of the air i nside the jar was adn average of 53(DEG) after ten minutes. The white ja r was and average of 42(DEG) after ten minutes. Since both jars started at 24(DEG), the temperature of the black jar increased 29(DEG) while th e temperature of the white only increased 18(DEG). The darker the color of something, the more heat the object absorbs. That means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse, even though that doghouse will wa rm up as well.

Second, the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence, or codon, and calls for a tRNA molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon. Third, after this process is repeated, the amino acids on the tRNA molecules form peptide bonds with each other, forming a protein. Finally, after the mRNA is translated until a stop codon, the protein is released and used in the cell as needed.

6120	3	0	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both need a wet, hot, climate. They are both different from pythons because pythons can't move into colder climates. Panda's and koalas can because they are bigger and fatter.
20600	8	2	During the story, Paul does not know much about Mr. Leonard. Paul only finds out about him when he talks to the school's track coach. The track coach had told him to visit a website, so Paul did and found out about Mr. Leonard. Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard could not read, he took it upon himself to repay Mr. Leonard for what he had done for him.

2997	2	3	In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
9379	4	1	The word invasive comes from the word invade which means to go into a place unwelcomed and unexpected. The word relates to the rest or the article because the the tittle says ''one mas pet another's invasive species'' and two the story discusses how the animals are being invasive in paragraph 11-17.

Paul was always chosen last for a basketball team so Mr. Leonard to Paul to the track to train him for hurdlers. I believe Mr. Leonard saw himself as Paul. In college, Mr. Leonard couldn't read and I'm sure he felt like an outsider. Therefore, Paul felt like an outsider when it came to being chosen last for a team everyday.
2879	2	2	A) In conclusion, plastic B had the most stretchability. ^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial & each plastic. The second way I would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch & be very presice about the time.
3157	2	0	Based on the student's data, plastic D stretched the same length for both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table, say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment. Another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two.
9244	4	1	To my knowledge invasive sort of means threat. The significance of this word to the rest of the article is most people would consider the animals sold invasive and or a threat.
6165	3	1	Both pandas and koalas and viewed a generaly ''cute'' animals, and your not usually scared of them because the are herbaviors, but pythons are generaly viewed as ugly'' things and people are usually scared of them because the eat meat.
5553	3	1	The panda from China and the kola from Australia are similar because they are both specialist. These two animals are different from pythons because pandas and koalas are only found in one area on the world. Where as the python is found across the world in many different contents and countries.
968	1	2	"There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment.

5490	3	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists. They have a very special diet, panda-bamboo and koala eucalyptus leaves, so they couldn't be able to adapt elsewhere. They are very different to pythons which are generalists. They can adapt to many surroundings and foods. Pythons will eat many things while pandas and koalas eat only one type of things.

Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started.
913	1	2	One thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2, to pour into the containers. Another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3. A last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for, in step 4.

5971	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat one type of food. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons can eat just about anything because when it went to a new habitat, it didn't die. This is because it didn't need food it had from old habitat to survive.

15062	6	0	The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane are *cytoplasm in the cell*the nucleoids in the cell*the nucleaus controls everything in the cell
14444	6	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.

6476	3	2	Panda's and Koala's are stated in the article to be located in different continents but they are similar in a way. Pandas and Koala's eat plants and nothing else, such as as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. Animals and reptiles are different because, in the article the author explained that pythons eat other animals such as an alligator. Therefore, states that Panda's and Koalas are different.
5295	3	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. A specialist is an animal that can't adapt well to new climates.

The final section talks about the power of space junk falling from the atmosphere. It also explains why it is a problem and how the problem is being fixed.
23851	9	2	The author organizes the article into three different sections. The first one is to explain what space junk really is, because some readers might not understand the concept of it. 'Crash Course,' shows why space junk is important. The author used many details like the collision between a Russian and an American satellite in February 2009, to show that this is a serious problem.The next section titled, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains that small or large fragments floating uncontrollably in Earth's orbit is a serious issue. Space junk should not be considered a minor matter.

Line 1: 'Grab you telescope! look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' The second section is background to give the reader a little knowledge about the topic. Line 4: 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched th efirst artificial satellite. The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.' The third section is what's going on now with the topic. Line 6: 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run th erisk o fcollding with each other. That's exactly what happened in February 2009.' The last section is why the reader should care about the topic. Line 8: 'So who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash?'

B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
17665	7	2	Rose does not want to her family to assume that she is lazy or that she feels overworked by helping her family because she cares for her family and feels guilty in a way by feeling overly busy.  An example of this is when she says, ''Do you feel so weighed down by what you;re doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer.  If she otld the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother'.
20145	8	2	The background information about Mr.Leonard motivated Paul and encourage him  of working harder. There are many plots that can support the point, among which one detail is predominant.  As it is mentioned in the paragragh, when Paul heard the experience of Mr. Leonard, he felt the same way as he is not a good reader and always feels the embarrassment when answering questions in front of the class. Mr.Leonard's story motivated him and implied the fact that if he doesn't study hard and give it up, it will cause a great pity in his life.   From what has been discussed above, the background information of Mr. Leonard had a positive influence on Paul, motivated him to work hard and made him eager to provide help for Mr. Leonard.
14764	6	1	The first process that cells use is diffusion. Cells have membranes that control what makes it into the cell and what cannot get inside the cell. The second process cells use are tunnel-like objects. Certain tunnels only can carry certain substances across the membrane and into the cell, such as a tunnel only being used for carbon. The third process cells use is called osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane. Water is a very simple and easy to carry molecule, so it easily diffuses, unless there is a balance of water on the inside and outside of the cell-equilibrium.

After he finds it, though, he feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. The parallel at the end of the story between Mr. Leonard helping out Paul in the beginning and Paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.

She speaks in a gentle voice, so as not to increase the despair that her younger sister is feeling. While speaking to Anna, Rose displays this specific character trait.  Anna was not completely satisfied with Rose's answer, but she still was able to go back to sleep.  In this, I think Rose shows the readers that she is indeed a caring person.

For example after Mr. Leonard tells Paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paul is happy because he fits in with Mr. Leonard and because he can help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles.

Diffusion is used to regulate substances with the outside environment using the cell membrane while osmosis transports water and other liquids through the membrane.  On the other hand, facilitated diffusion is a type of active transport.  It is also a type of diffusion, albeit it uses energy to transport the substances out of the cell.

Plastic A is stretched the bigest throughout the experiment while plastic D shoved no change B. ^p The student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic. would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid.
3718	2	2	Based on the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability. The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less.

23018	9	2	The author divided this article into sections. The begining of the article is just an introduction that is suppose to grab the reader's attention and help them to become intrested. The next section 'What is Space Junk?' is the foundation of the rest of the article. It is included to help explain in a simple form what is space junk, why it is floating, and how it was placed up there.        The next section 'Crash Course' is includede to explain how the objects could possible be dangerous and to tell what has happened in the past that has proved them to be a negative and danger. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is to explain how little objects can actually have a very large impact on the satellites. It significanfies how it doesn;t matter what size the object is, it still creates a large problem.     The author probably wrote this article this way because he wanted to but it into the sinplest form and explain all parts of the question.

24137	9	2	The author organizes the article into four major groups; the introduction, 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
26861	10	0	black :: bacause its black
18106	7	0	One trait that Rose described with her conversation with her Aunt Kolab might be that shes actually understood, her Aunt Kolab sees her stress and her fustration. Rose wants to do everything she possibly can but its too much for one person. Shes working at a resturante for four hours after school. Shes going to school. She helps her Aunt Kolab with supper and she finds time to do her homework. Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation. When her Aunt Kolab realizes that Rose is working really hard and is fustrated with everything, she talks to her to try and understand or see if theirs anything she can do for Rose. The talk helps it shows that Rose is being looked after and that her family can see how hard she is working.
26141	10	0	light gray :: if the color are ligth gray than the dog hous e the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz i t light...
6371	3	1	Panda and Koala eat the same type of plants.
26978	10	2	dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it will keep warm i n side but also it will keep cool when needed, so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool bu t also warm as well. I know this because with the dark gray average tempe rature was 48 (DEG)c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 (DEG)c and the white average was 42 (DEG)c.
27357	10	2	dark gray :: the darker the color of the doghouse the hott er it will be, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the w inter you dont want it to be white. so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer i t wont attract as much as the black would
467	1	3	"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
15116	6	1	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Diffusion always substances to move across the cell by slowly being moved through the cell membrane. Facititated diffusion always larger objects to be moved across the cell membrane. Osmosis is where something is moved into the cell by shrinking it and then it regains its shape after being moved into the cell.
20808	8	2	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader, he realizes they are alike. It makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read and it makes Mr. Leonard to help Paul feel accepted by helping him with track. It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking.
5332	3	0	Pandas and koalas are the same because they're both specialists. Each of them eats almost nothing but bamboo or eucalyptus leaves, which is also what makes them specialists, as stated in paragraph 21.
5140	3	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat plants for most of their life. They are also similar because they are both specialist that live in warm areas. The two are different from pythons because a python is a generalist, which depends on other animals to survive such as a raccon.
20879	8	1	Paul was shocked. He did not know what to think.
26489	10	1	dark gray :: dark gray would be better because you dont wa nt the dog to be cold if it were to live in the dog house but you dont wa nt it to be to warm for the dog.
11303	5	0	interphase, anaphase, telephase, prophase
659	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, you would need to how to determine mass. Not to mention, you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry.
14304	6	0	The Cell membrane controls what comes in and out of the cell.The Cell Wall creates a outside barrier around the cell, to protect it.
3227	2	2	The conclusion of this experiment would be that type B was the most amount stretched, it stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type A stretched the least. In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, is to always give it a 3rd try. What is your control.
21542	8	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.
24515	9	0	The author organizes the article, in a simple way. The author gives you thanking at first than using statistics and makes you thank bout what is gonna happen to all that space junk.
11433	5	1	after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is taken to the ribosome by tRNA and it is made into proteins
1382	1	2	This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
10976	5	1	first the mRNA leaves the cell nucleus and moves to the ribosome where tRNA finds complementary bases
1630	1	3	To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
12374	5	0	Instuctions come form the nucleas and with amino acids go to build protein with help from the mRNA
14803	6	0	The cell membrane lets stuff in and out.
6520	3	1	"Pandas and Koalas are similar because they both stay to one food source unlike a python. A python will adapt to any food source it has readily available to them. As the last part of the article says, "" we will live in an age that favors generalists and specialists."" This quote means that the animal that can adapt will survive."
9616	4	0	"Now, because of the environmental description, many problems are invasive people. ""Invasive"" remind me that if we still destroy the environment,we may face going exact, so we should protect environment like planting trees, do the things we can do, and try our best to protect environment."
9499	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is passing judgement. Invasive is reaching a habitat of a place your not used to. It can be harm or major threats to biodiversity. When anything can go anywhere. That's when complications come in."
11339	5	0	The steps are: The enzymes leave, the nucleus gets smaller, the rybosomes get rid of waist, and the rybonuclaic acid eats away the nucleus.
27055	10	1	white :: its would make the temperature inside the dog house not as hot so the dog does not overheat
27181	10	2	white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog wil l be. When the lid color was at it's darkest (black) the average temperat ure was 53 degrees celcius. When the lid color was at it's lightest (whit e) the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius. If Brandi and Jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool, they should use white paint.
14744	6	0	some cells use tale like structurs called fegilia to move. others use use cilia or slide.
20512	8	2	Mr. Leonard has helped Paul building his skill as a hurdler and Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
24687	9	2	The just use thing they know and but things where they belong. Like 'What is Space Junk' it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements. They always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under. They never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under 'What is Space Junk' it just dosent fit. They only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about.
12340	5	0	1.you can eat alot of healthy foods to get protein.                        2.you can excersise everyday and drink alot of water to get            protein.                                                                                  3.you can be in a arobics class to keep track in your protein.        4.drink alot of milk.
9802	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" in the article means they are bad. Acording to the article ""Invasive species"" is unfair he said .""They're introduced I think that invasive is passing judgement"". In other word it not a good name to call them."
20403	8	2	Paul is shocked by the background information that he receives from Mr. Leonard. Paul first learns that Mr. Leonard won the four hundred meter hurdles at nationals and broke records. Paul is suprised by this because that is a great achievement, and is courious what happened after that and why he works at her school. He also learns that Mr. Leonard can't read and this effects him because she can relate to this because he also can't read and has to go to a learning center to get help.
23010	9	1	How does the author organize the article? He organizes it in a good way. He has a good introduction explaining the whole plot of the story, then he gives acouple facts, then after that he implies why those facts are important and what will happen if the problems continue to grow.
11001	5	1	There four major steps of protien synthesis. The first is the mRNA going to the rRNA. Then the rRNA takes the information from the mRNA to the tRNA. Next the tRNA will take the information it has and translate it. Lastly, the tRNA will take the information and make a protein.
18345	7	1	One important trait that can describe Rose would be responsiblity. She knows that she has duties to attend and she is only in high school. Rose does what she needs to do then helps her aunt and holds a job all at the same time. That is very responsible to me. Also knowing she has a paper to do, but not enough time to do this paper. Rose does it anyways.
9731	4	1	The significance of the word invasive in the article is to show that some people call wild animals such as shakes pet and others call them wild animals.Some invasive animal are crocodiles, a scorpion,rattlesnake,a boa constructor and a cobra.
5958	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are innocent. The article states how they only eat bamboo or eucalyptus. However, they differ from pythons because pythons eat other animals and can be harmful to humans. They compared two innocent animals to a dangerous one.
9650	4	1	The word invasive comes up a lot in this article. I believe the significance of this word in this article is that when 2 species meet each other that tends to be an ''invasive'' environment. I say this because in the article the author says, ''we live in an age that factors generalists.'' This is an example of factor of they invasive behavior.
11785	5	0	DNA is copied into a smaller form called messanger RNA or mRNA and then that is copied into tranfer RNA or tRNA to be transfered and replectated once the nucleotide sequences are copied back into mRNA then a new cell has a new set of complete DNA.
11843	5	0	tRNA, is the transporterRNA,DNA, the structure of an organismmRNA,
6668	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both live in one area and basically only eat one kind of food, while python can live in a couple of other places and eats more than one type of food.
20275	8	0	THE BACKGROUND INFORMATION MR. LEONARD GETS ON PAUL IS HE CAN RUN TRACK. HE RAN IN COLLEGE AND DID NOT TELL ANYONE. THE FOUND OUT WHEN HE RAN TRACK OUTSIDE ONE DAY.
8216	4	1	The word ''invasive'' means that the reptiles are entering an environment in which  they don't belong. This term is important to the article because if they didn't enter the new habitat none of the issues mentioned would have been a problem.
48	1	0	There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
14148	6	2	One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis. Cells use osmosis to either gain or get rid of water by passing it across the cell membrane.      Another process used by cells is cellular diffusion. This is like osmosis, it is the process of substances moving from an area of high concentration, to an area of low concentration.
21241	8	1	After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about the past, the expressions on his face seem all too real and familiar to Paul. He then feels that Mr. Leonard has given his time to help him, so he does the same for Mr. Leonard.
5403	3	0	Panda's in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, they rely on one specific thing to live which is their food. They need stability to live. pythons are different fro pandas and koala's because they are generalists, they rely on change to survive.
24210	9	2	The author organizes this article by starting out with a general idea, then focusing into details of that idea as you continue on in the section. In the introduction, the idea of space junk is first introduced in a catchy way. Next, in the first section, space junk is defined for the reader and it is explained why space junk is in space. Then, in the next section, Crash Course, some problems with space junk are introduced, as well as some more details. Finally, in the last section, the idea that space junk can be problematic is introduced. Supporting details are added to the section and then the author wraps up the article. The author has organized this article by starting with a general topic of space junk, then adding more detail and ideas to that topic as the article continues.
5950	3	1	"Pandas and koalas both require a specific environment to live in. Joel Achaboch writes ""China's panda, which etas almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"" (One Man's Pet, Another's Invasive Species). Without these specific foods, a panda and koala would die. However, a python can eat many different foods and/can live anywhere on the planet that suits it's climate needs."
18684	7	0	Rose is uptight.  This is apparent when she dreams of Paul smashing her and feels weighed down by what she's doing for the family.
20240	8	2	He felt connected to him because he knew how it felt to be embarrased about not being able to read well. He wants to repay him for all the help Mr. Leonard gave him.
281	1	3	To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
26073	10	2	black :: The doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outsi de. When the black lid was used in the expiriment, it was on averag e 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid, 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid, and 11 degrees warmer than the white. The refore, if the doghouse is painted black, the dog will keep warm much bet ter than if the doghouse was painted dark gray, light gray, or white.
6394	3	2	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. These two animals differ from pythons because pythons are generalists. Specialist can only live one areas nway in contrast to generalist who can adapt and live almost anywhere.
12336	5	0	The mRNA takes the proteins. Then goes to another cell and transfers the protein to that cell. Then it rides to the nucleus and dumps off the information it is carrying. Then it dies.
23536	9	2	The author organizes ideas by grouping and titling paragraphs. The paragraph titled 'What is Space Junk?', consists of information about what 'Space Junk' actually is. The author also lists details of conflicts with satellites, and crashes that have occured in the past.
6291	3	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both generalist species. Pythons are a specialist species. The article states that ""we live in an age that leaves generalists rather than specialists"". People in general tend to relate better to a panda rather than a snake. The article says being it is ""no mistake"", That the generalist species do better in places they live in."
775	1	0	To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
5463	3	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because their diets is plants, while pythons diet is meat. In paragraph 21, it says ""China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalptus leaves..."""
18493	7	2	Very hopeful for good to come to her life. She is optimistic in that she wants everything to be better in her life and she tries to see that through Aunt Kolab and Anna. The hope with that she speaks of with Anna is that they must help Paul finish college so that he can send Rose and Anna to college. The hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with Aunt Kolab. She finds what to write about in this speaking with Aunt Kolab.
5857	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both from the same specie. They are different because China's panda, eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Pythons are generalist a raccon, a cockroach.
2969	2	3	A)In conclusion, plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material. The best plastic type would be A. Plastic type A can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping. ^p B) These students should have conducted a third trial. It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type. Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags.
21345	8	2	When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. He did not know that he was a record breaking track runner, or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage.
14783	6	0	cells use vacuoles to break down any free living substances, cellular respiration for the cell to breathe, use the membrane to keep out any unwanted substances.
1550	1	1	This group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to replicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better.
24400	9	2	By explaining what is space junk and describing how it got out in space and is still out there. Then talks about crash couses that has happened out in space and the materials is still out there. Finally talks about all the little pieces and how space ships have the hardest time driving through space avoiding all the garbage floating around.
11148	5	2	1. The mRNA goes to the ribosome.2. The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.3. The tRNA comes and attaches to the mRNA, to begin protein synthesis.4. Protein synthesis continues until a stop codon signals to stop.
11561	5	0	mRNA splits up and meets with the Nuclaic Acid. Then it is combined with Phosphate to create a protein.
193	1	0	"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
24004	9	1	The author starts off with something interesting to get the readers attention. Then he expalined the reason for his opening statement, after that he told us what space junk a little background history and simpla facts about it. then he closes with why it matters. why they little tiny space debris or junk matter. because it is harmful.
20961	8	2	From the way that Paul responded from the information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed suprised and kind of anrgy that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him. Once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell Paul, i think Paul understood more. I think now Paul has more of a connection with Mr. Leonard because they have something in common. Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles. Towards the end of the story it makes them closer.
486	1	0	To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
12464	5	0	starting with mrna, it reads the bonds like instructions, then sends this to the nuclesous to get transfered into the second strain. After that it is transfered to the RNA strain, which is turned into the last form. Then is Hocked to the hydroxide bonds.
875	1	1	"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
9217	4	1	"Invasive referred to ""invasive species"". Invasive species are species of animals that are not native to the given area they're in. ""Life on Earth never cruel but never so fast"". This article in paragraph 7 of the article refer to what invasive species are. They are life that is introduced to new places quicker than naturally."
12114	5	0	One major step involed in protein synthesis is when the food enters the cell, the cell breaks it down and seperates the protein and the fatty foods.
5105	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia. Panda eat almost nothing but bamboo or Australia koala bear which eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because the species have become most abandunt are often those that do best in and around humans.
24698	9	0	He tells people how their is junk from the satelites hitting each other and that their is junk every where in the orbits.
11400	5	0	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus it has begins to go through transcription that occurs in the cytoplasm. In transcription parts of the protein will be broken into chains so it cna be matched up later. After, it will go through translation where the mRNA is translated into a polypeptide.The mRNA will match up with one of the single stranded RNA to make a new string of DNA.
26196	10	2	white ::  how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the avera ge temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
5865	3	2	Panda bears and koala bears are similar because they both eat one specific thing. Panda bears eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because seem toeat meat substances. He one ate a alligator. They eat things that take them linger to swallow and break it down than koala & panda bears.
14017	6	0	Diffusion, Osmosis, Endocytosis
8535	4	0	The animals are brought in and have to feid for themselves. Some do it very well.
12622	5	0	They are mRNA DNA RNA ANA
12137	5	0	It then goes through the dna to the rna and out to the trna which transfers it to the cellular membrane.
6181	3	0	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both eat plants and do not go looking for prey like cobras will. Cobras will travel everywhere looking for food.
4041	2	3	a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
21565	8	0	It effects Paul because at first that he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was an athlete. after Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was an athlete that changed Paul. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he wasn't good at reading at all. so, after Mr. Leonard helped Pau out with his problem. Paul helped Mr. Leonard with his problem.
3810	2	0	(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment.
5631	3	0	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both really only eat one type of food. Unlike pythons who eat everything if their hungry. According to the article, ""China's panda, which eats nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" In other words everyone has their own to able but they are for aspect."
26774	10	2	dark gray ::  the color dark gray because it would keep the dog house cool for the dog because the average temp. was 48(DEG)
21180	8	1	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again.
21214	8	1	The background information Paul aquires allows Paul to understand him more and where Mr. Leonard is coming from. It motivates Paul to work hard at hurdles and to keep working hard for his grades.
15089	6	0	For cells to move some use the flagellum. It is like a tail and moves so the cell can reach it's destination. Other cells also scatter around until it find the right place. Last but not least alot of cells have tiny hairs that have a certain movement to get it where it needs to go.
1575	1	0	Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
15299	6	0	1.it controls the blood going through your veins2.it filters the waist products3.it helps the blood count?
21239	8	0	Paul is emberassed about not being going to the Learning center and it dont seem like he really wanted to tell him where he was going.  Mr. Leonard tries to help him with some stuff i gym because he gets picked last.
14020	6	0	One is by moving the cell away from harmful areas. Another is moving the harmful stuff from the cell and bringing in the good stuff. Lastly the cell can move its self to places where it can get more food or water, etc.
24586	9	0	They out it in order of how is goes. And it has great details of explaining this. About the space and the ships and how they are made and all that kind of stuff.
26399	10	2	black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it, bec ause black got the highest average of 53 C(DEG)
24173	9	2	The author of 'Orbiting Junk' effectively organizes his piece to inform the reader of the dangers of space trash. He begins with an introduction, and gives the reader interest along with the basic background needed to understand the purpose of the article.      The author then moves into the section of 'What is Space Junk,' where he proceeds to the story of the great space invasion. He tells the reader of the many satellites within our atmosphere from this race, and introduces the idea of the satellite malfunctioning and creating 'space junk.'     In 'Crash Course' and 'Little Bits, but a Big Deal' the author uses strong language, unknown problems with space junk, and a real life example to convince the reader of how harmful space junk is to the human race. He ends with a conclusive paragraph that the dangers of space junk are actually increasing, leaving with the small hope that there is a solution in the works to stop the space pollution.
20988	8	2	After reading and finding out all he did about Mr. Leonard, Paul felt that he was no longer alone in feeling left out. He had finally found someone who in all reality, was just like him. As Paul talks to Mr. Leonard about what he read and seeing his reaction to the things that were discussed, Paul decided the best thing to do was to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him learn to read.
19975	8	0	When Paul gets some background information on Mr. Leonard he finds out that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He also found out that he broke records. When Paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it Mr. Leonard told him that school was hard for him and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. Paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him. So that is just what he does about it.
21579	8	0	In the story Mr. Leonard and Paul had started a conversation about if they were a good athlete. Mr. Leonard said that he was a good athlete, but not a good student when it came to school.They didnt have any learning centers in our school, he always relied on friends to help him get by, even then the work was always too hard. Then Mr. Leonard had embarrassment feelingd when Paul was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer to the question, like everybody else knew.
21735	8	0	Mr. Leonard feels that Paul will not be able to get any where without being able to read.
9118	4	2	"Some biologists believe that ""invasive species"" hold a threat while others like MacInnes consider them to be an ""introduced"". The rest of the article is contemplating whether or not pythons are a threat to other animals and people.

14975	6	3	THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.

3797	2	1	Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
3876	2	3	Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm.

They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
27018	10	2	white ::  White because in the data it say that white had the lowest tempature with a average of 42(DEG)C. If the they painted it white, it would keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days.
3694	2	3	"a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least"", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results."

For example, Skin Snow says that the snakes are unwanted and are eating endangered species. He believes that snakes are invasive, and should not be brought to the US while MacInnes believes the reptiles should be here. In short, invasive is passing judgement"" over the reptiles saying they're invasive ""."

10995	5	1	Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus it has to make another kind of RNA to transfer the information to the other parts of the cells and the body. The codons of the messenger RNA are matched up with their codons for a transfer RNA. The transfer RNA is made and can then continue to do its job while more transfer RNAs are being copied. Then the Rnas can go to the ribosomes and give them the message to make more proteins.

24724	9	2	The organization of the article is information in each section, while collectively, the sections map out a situation that could cause 'space junk.' The introduction, which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'What is Space Junk' immediately afterword. Before defining space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful. The organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear, yet non-descript situational plot.

23916	9	2	The author organizes the article by putting them into subgroups. We start of with the Orbiting Junk subgroup, which is the opening paragraghs. Next, we move on to What Is Space Junk, which explains the history of space exploration. It also talks about the problems with this though, and how when a satellite 'dies' it just keeps going in space. That is how we get Space Junk. Next we have Crash Course, which focuses on one important crash that occured between two satellites. This is important because it talks about one main important moment when space junk really became a problem. Last, they have Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This part is the conclusion, and talks about all the problems space junk can cause. It gives us examples like in paragragh 10 about the lost tool bag. This is important because it gives us a idea of just how dangerous this is. So that is how the author organizes this well written article. It helps keep it organized and makes it easier as a reader to read.

26866	10	1	white ::  well when it gets hot in the summer the dog w ill be cooler and white goes with everything.
27159	10	2	white ::  The lighter the color, the less air temperature. The white lid color has an average of 42(DEG) C. The black lid color has an average of 53(DEG) C. The white lid color has 11(DEG) C less heat energy than the black lid color. Therefore, If Brandi and Jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer, then they should use the color white since it' ll be cooler... Vise versa, if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color. The darker the color, the more heat.

6315	3	2	Pandas in China along with koalas in Australia are similar for they have very specific needs of conditions of survival because pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. A python though doesn't need as specific of living arrangnents besides a warm climate.
5599	3	1	"Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals, ""A specialist is China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" Pythons on the other hand can survive anywhere that is worth making them generalists, their food source isn't going anywhere and they can adapt to a change in their food diet."
6338	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they're herbivores. They don't have meat in their diets. They eat plants that are also very similar. Koalas eat eucalyptus and pandas eat bamboo. Also, they are both specialists unlike pythons which are generalists. People don't want to harm or take koalas and pandas. Pythons are generalist who w/ assistance can live anywhere.

3189	2	1	From the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more. It looks like the second trial for A, B, C, O hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ,ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. So youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve.
11159	5	1	Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, these four major steps are involved in protein synthesis:1)Ribosomes (or rRNA) attach to the strand of mRNA.2)tRNA (transport ribonucleic acid) attaches to the mRNA with a specific anticodon holding a special amino acid for that mRNA sequence.3)Once one anticodon is attached, that tRNA releases itself from the mRNA, for only one tRNA can be on at a time.4)Once the new protein is formed, the ribosomes lets go of the mRNA and release the newly formed protein into the cytoplasm of the cell.

2804	2	2	A conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type D stretches the most, plastic type D stretches the second most, plastic C the third most and plastic A the least most. The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment.
6170	3	1	Pandas and koalas both from different countries only eat one kind of food exclusively. They're different from pythons because pythons have a large varity of foods from many places. '' Animals such as lizards and snakes tend at least in this culture to be less well respected or supported'' that's another difference between them.
18621	7	1	Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true.

12576	5	0	The first step for mRNA leaving the nucleus is that it heads to a protein, it goes to a protein so it can attach itself. The second step is the mRNA puts in information from the nuclues, this helps so that the proteins can get messages to do things so that it can do what the nucleus needs it to do. Then the protein will start to create new proteins, so that the cell can survive, this will help so that the cell will be healthy and can do more tasks. The final step is the mRNA leaves the protein and goes back to the nucleus, so that the mRNA can go to another cell. This process helps so that there are more proteins in the cell, and then it can create more energy. This also carries amino acid sequences to the proteins so they can produce, or use them for energy.

26965	10	2	white ::  I chose the color white for the doghouse. Thi s is because if the darker the color, the greater increase in temperature , then I would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray, dark gray and black. This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer. The darker the color, the greater increase in temperat ure is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar w ith the black lid was 53(DEG) C when the average temperature of the insi de of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. The white lid jar was 11 (DEG) cooler than the black lid jar.

24299	9	1	I think the author organizes the article very well. The author organized it so you know when you are changing subjects and so you will know the different things the author is talking about. Everything you need to know about space junk is divided into different areas so you won't have to learn about too much at one time.
5945	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. Pandas almost only eat bamboo and koalas almost they have a wider variety of prey. They can eat anything that will fit into their mouths.
6412	3	2	"Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both "" specialists. In the article it say panda's eat bamboo exclusively and Koala eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different from pythons because a python's because a python will eat a wide variety of foods. And a python is classified as a ""generalists"" as said in the article , meaning its more adaptive than a panda or Koala  bear."
24602	9	1	The author organizes this article so that the first thing you read catches your attention. If the very first part of this didn't catch your attention then you wouldn't want to read anymore of the article. The second part you read makes you courious about what the article is.      The third thing you read tells you how much of a serious matter this is. The fourth thing you read, What Is Space Junk?, gives you more background about the topic. The fifth thing you read tells you how it happens. The very last thing you read is going to be why exactly it's so important and the dangers of space junk.
6604	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both harmless creatures. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They are both different than pythons because they don't eat or scare people. A python eats humans if they get the chance. Pandas and koalas are harmless and a python is harmful.

(B) To improve the validity of the results I would've measured the plastic's width. To improve the design, I would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results.
3786	2	3	A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
24423	9	2	Firstly the author grabs the readers attention. Then author jumpss right into details as two what is 'space junk' is and how it got into space. Thirdly  the author explains how satellites collide in space and become 'space junk'. Lastly the author imposes on the danger and importance of preventing space pollution.

5318	3	1	In the article it is stated that python is a generalist species while a panda or a koala is a specialist. What this means is that specialists clearly need an environment that they have fully developed too so they can survive ( the need for bamboo and eucalyptus leaves, Whereas pythons can survive anywhere as long as there is some temp influence on them and that is the difference.
8922	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" normallis refers to a species which has made itol at name somewhere it shouldn't be. But according to MacInner the term ""invasive species"" is unfair. According to him the pythons are introduced t that ""invasive"" is an unfair judgement past an the animals."
3462	2	1	(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
27544	10	2	white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.
23621	9	1	The author tells the readers that sometimes the human race are polloting the space with garbage and other junk.
5366	3	1	The pandas in China and the koalas in Australia are both similar. The pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas eat nothing but eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because of the fact that they both eat only one type of food. They are different from a python because a python eats alot of things. One python was caught eating an alligator and a Key largo wood rat.
26164	10	1	light gray :: Light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would.
19966	8	2	The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he was a track star through high school and his freshman year in college, but that he didn't know how to read. His grades were terrible and he flunked out of college despite being an incredible runner, it didn't help him academically. One of the best runners in history who broke records had more in common with Paul than he could have ever imagined. Paragraph 45 states, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feeling of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could for him.' Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard also cannot read but took his time out of his day to teach Paul how to excel at something that he did know how to do, and knew how to do it very well. Paul returns this favor to the best of his ability by trying to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paragraph 46 says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, I said, walking back toward the school. It's time to start your training.'

26945	10	2	white :: The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way. The color white dosn't absorb as much heat as the other colors do. When they did the experiment the color white only got to 42(DEG) C while the color black got to 53(DEG) C. Also, white turned out to be the color that absorbed the least heat of only 42(DEG) C. Which means insid e the doghouse it will stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as mu ch heat as the other colors do.

Mr. Leonard explained that he had been a good runner but had struggled with the school work and lost his scholarship, causing him to flunk our of college. Paul felt he could relate to Mr. Leonard about the familiar feeling at not doing well at school and realized what he could do for him. Telling him 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' as they walked back towards the school. 'It's time to start your training.'. So now they have both learned something from eachother, one was how to work hard and become good at a sport, and then teach one how to read better.

24647	9	1	The author organizes the article in a fair manner. He explains how the 'space junk' is really a serious matter. He states how some people might not care about this space junk, but they're are a great amount of people who care about what is exposed to outside of the earth. Not only is that junk but it is things to give us and NASA information. It also gives a good example of how the junk is released which they created a paragraph, 'Crash Course'. The paragraph, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' also explains how people don care about this junk.
16956	7	2	Rose is thoughtful and caring.  She has plenty of topics or activities in her life that she could be complaining about; however she puts others before herself.       For example in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose if the work she does to help the family 'weighs her down'.  Rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt.  Therefore, one can see Rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful.

When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
5779	3	1	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because both animals basically eat one thing. A panda eats bamboo and a koala mostly eats eucalyptus leaves. Both animals only eat plant. But a python does not. A python has to eat other organisms based on its size. A panda and koalas are similar but a python has many differences.

365	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.

He later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read. He explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up. And he did that by encouraging the narrator that he is very lucky to be at a school that is willing to offer certain programs.
3187	2	3	A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
24140	9	2	The author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections.  The first section is just the opening that catches one's attention.  The second section is explaining what the space just is.  Without this section, one may be confused as to what the author is talking about.  The third section is about times when objects in space have collided and made lots of debris that is still floating around today.  Finally, the last section is talking about how even though there are just tiny bits of debris, it is still very dangerous.  This is a very good way for the author to present their information.

23297	9	1	The author starts off the article with a simple introduction that will grab the reader's attention because of the funny reference. The author slowly goes into the importance of the debris floating around in space. The next paragraph of the article starts to inform the reader just what is space junk to clear up any other myth about it.        The examples of stories and even facts about what exactly is orbiting our earth keeps the article's main purpose flowing. Their idea was to lead into the true facts that the amount of debris orbiting with the earth is a great amount. The last paragraph is meant to leave the reader thinking about what is actually going on in the space above us.

6422	3	1	The similarities with the pandas in China and the koalas in Australia is that they are both harmless animal that all they do is eat one typeof food bamboo for the pandaand eucalyptus leaves for the koala. They are different then pythons because pythons are more active and to do more things than the koala & panda.
3768	2	3	I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.

The author first starts the article with an introduction paragraph about space junk that foreshadows what the rest of the article contains. Then the article has a section that gives background infromation about how space junk came to life. The next section gives actual examples of what can happen when random space junk is orbiting the Earth. Finally, the last section tells the reader how dangerous space junk can be at high speeds and how this space pollution is still affecting space travel today.

In the passage she is worried at first about her family and isn't sure if things will get better because her mom's never home and her dad doesn't live with them because he got a better job in Los Angeles that pays three times more than his old job when he lived with them. After Rose had a talk with her Aunt Kolab she started believing that she can help make things better and she would do her best to make that happen.
5341	3	0	Pandas in China and koalas bears in Australia are similar in that they are both specialist species. This means they are restricted to limited environments and only eat one type of food. As a result, these animals are less capable of adapting. A python however, is much more flexible. It is a generalist species better suited for survival. It is different also because it can live in different climates and eats different things.

14905	6	3	Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.

Pandas and koalas are both different from pythons because they are more prone to survive in almost any climate, while pandas live specifically in China and koalas in Australia. Pythons are more abundant.
14436	6	1	Osmosis is when water comes through the cell membrane.  Other times the cell opens its membrane and allows a substance to enter.  The last type is when a substance exits the membrane may open up to allow the object out.

5535	3	2	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both specialists. As the article said, they eat only one kind of food, and live in only one place. This makes them different from pythons, which have proven themselves to be generalists, which were, originally from Asia. However, once introduced here, they can survive and thrive in the southern U.S.

Like Mr. Leonard, he got into college for track, the coaches said he would get tutors and they could teach him how to read. All though he didn't learn how to read in college, he still had something to be proud about. First man to make it into college without knowing how to read, that should be a great accomplishment.

15049	6	3	The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

Paul says, after learning how Mr. Leonard funked out of college because he could not read, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment...' (45). This describes the situation Paul is going through right now and it provides a stronger connection between the two characters.
541	1	2	"The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the ""four samples"". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig."

2821	2	3	In conclusion, the polymer with the most stretchability is Polymer B in T1 and T2 polymer B had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers. There for it stretched the greatest amount. In the future I think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer. I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results.
11610	5	1	As the mRNA leaves the nuclear pore a rRNA comes and aids the process. The tRNA comes and has complementary codons to make a amino acid. Then another tRNA comes and copies the next segment on the mRNA to makes a different amino acid. This is done with the ribosomal RNA at each segment being copied. After doing this process for awhile it forms a polypeptide or protien.

2829	2	2	(A) Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D. ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.

26828	10	2	white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler. This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog. In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11(DEG)c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler.

21066	8	2	I personally think Mr. Leonard giving Paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated Paul and made him want to help Mr. Leonard. The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading.

23695	9	2	The author organizes the article by different concerns. For example, the first section, 'What Is Space Junk?' describes what 'space junk' is and how it negatively affects the environment. The second section, 'Crash Course', describes how the colliding of satellites affects the amount of microsatellites 'flying through space', which proposes a huge problem for astronauts trying to maneuver around them. The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', describes that while the space debris may be very small they can pose a lot of damage on other spacecrafts, which could ultimately jeopardize the safety of astronauts.

6139	3	1	The panda and the koala are harmless animals. They do not eat rats, alligators, or humans. They are different like snakes.
5894	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are each specialists, They eat a special type of food exclusively. However pythons are generalists and can adapt to almost anywhere.
8256	4	1	"The word invasive is significant to the article because generalist species, like the pythons are spreading around and invading on human life. The article states, "" helped drag hundreds of Burmese Pythons out of the weeds, off roadways and even from under the hood of a tourist's car ! (9)"
2792	2	3	a.One conclusion I can draw is that plastic B stretched the most than there was plastic D, the next plastic C and finally plastic A. b. They could have used more trials. Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.
27248	10	1	white ::  The color white is a combination of all of th e known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while proj ecting the combination color that it produces.
140	1	2	The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
3974	2	1	a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
1250	1	3	To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same. The materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment.
8248	4	1	The word invasive in this article refers to the species of animals living in an area  that they shouldn't be due to human intervention either by bringing them here physically, or destroying their homes so they have nowhere else to go except where they are generally unwanted.
26311	10	2	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.
20830	8	2	that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow . Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college. So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
21731	8	2	The background information has a positive effect on Paul because it reminds him of himself. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and neither can Paul. They both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them. The background information brings Paul closer to Mr. Leonard and gives not only Mr. Leonard to help Paul, but Paul a chance to help Mr. Leonard.
5752	3	2	"Pandas and koalas are similar because both eat almost one food. ""...China's panda, which eats almost nothing than bamboo. Koalas bear... eats leavs."" They are both very different from pythons because of what they eat pythons eat a lot of them. ""A python swallowed an alligator..."" This shows how pythons eat almost an thing while panda and koalas won't."
8625	4	1	I think the word invasive is very significant to this article. I think this because in the article it uses invasive to explain how the pythons have started to take over the Evergreens.
26928	10	0	white :: my dog like white
3465	2	2	One conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B stretched the most (22 mm and 23 mm) out of all the plastics. Also, plastic type A stretched the least, only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm. This is a conclusion that can be drawn. ^p To improve the validity of the experiment, the students could name the four plastics used. Also to have accurate data, the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying ''measure its length''. Also adding a control would be helpful as well. This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment.

He then explains what space junk is so we understand what he is talking about later on the article better. After he explains what space junk is he talks about the history of us invading space and how stuff gets left behind. Then he explains how space junk is a serious matter to earth and the people heading to space.
6794	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat almost nothing but a specific plant like (koalas eat eucalyptus leaves, while pandas eat bamboo), they are far different from pythons by their appearance, and what they eat (pythons eat anything that fit's in it's thin, pipe-like stomach).
833	1	3	In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.

Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
18395	7	0	One trait I can think of would be unsure of herself. She seems to be unsure if she can help out her family like the others. like she questions whether or not she is capable.She feels as though she would be a let down if she was not able to help out. One detail would be when her aunt ask her ' Do you feel so weighed down by waht you're doing to help this family?', she was unable to answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.

835	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment.
18028	7	2	Rose is determined. She's not only worried about herself, but Paul also. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She's willing to do whatever it takes for her family so Paul can get a good job and her and her sister Anna can go to college.
21707	8	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard i'm sure that he is encouraged to do well simply because now he knows he's being coached by a talented star in his day, it's motivation. Then when he finds out that he can't read as well, i feel it motivates him even more because Mr. Leonard was a great track star that flucked college due to the lack of available help. Paul not just has the training of Mr. Leonard and the track team to help him with track, but he also has the help of the leraning center to help him read, and he can be successful if he keeps at it.

27137	10	1	white ::  it would be best to paint the dog house white because it won't make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out. White won't attract as much heat inside the dog house, as we discovered in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter col or. As the colors got darker, the temperature got hotter.
26481	10	2	black ::  if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day. I can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53(DEG) and that was the highest temperature there was this is why I think Brandi and Jerry should use black for there dog house.
2801	2	3	a) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible, stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first. b) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways.

3087	2	3	a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.

18475	7	1	Rose is a supportive sister. Rose holds back her emotions when she talks to her sister, Anna. Anna is upset about their father leaving and their mom being away for a while. Rose feels similarly about the burden of supporting their brother. She chooses to say that everything will work out to try and support her sister instead of letting her know her actual thoughts.
14772	6	2	Cells have receptors on their outside, that are in the phospholipid bilayer, that only allow substances in if they match up to the receptors perfectly. Cells also use a process in which they form a 'bubble' around a substance (endocytosis) that they want to bring into the cell (this uses ATP). Another process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the membrane is exocytosis, which is when the cell gets rid of substances by forming a 'bubble' around the substance and sending it out of the cell. This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal.
8170	4	0	Invasive is seen as an inappropriate term in this article as compared to introduced. ''Invasive species is unfair, they're introduced. Invasive is passing judgement.''
1520	1	3	You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
17160	7	1	From her conversations with Anna, I conclude that Rose is like a mother figure to Anna sometimes. She tries to stay positive so her little sister doesn't get discouraged. In the story, it states that Anna says, 'You sound just like Mama.' This shows that Rose has the traits of a mother figure in their relationship. Since Rose is the older sister, she has to look over her little sister when her mother is gone.

8976	4	1	Invasive is important because some people support new animals to the U.S while others call them invasive species. This means that these species are invading and sometimes killing off other species of animals.
11088	5	0	After mRNA leaves with information, it then takes it to tRNA. After this is done tRNA is helping produce atp for protiens. After this process is done rRNA comes in. RRNA is later fixing together the protiens.
18013	7	2	Rose is very responsible, and she states: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
8856	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that it means most animals are becoming extinct because of the snakes that have been lose. The snakes are eating most of the animals."
5424	3	1	Both panda's from China and koalas in Australia eat constantly. And there different from pythons because they do not eat as much species as a python does. There also different because in paragraph 20 it says that pythons are generalist. And pandas from China, or koalas from Australia aren't.
3327	2	1	Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.

26688	10	2	white ::  The best color for the dog house is white. This is because acording to Brandies and Jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house. For the Black dog house the average temperature would be 53(DEG)C for the Dark Grey dog house the average temperature would be 48(DEG)C for the Light Grey dog house the teperature would be 45(DEG)C and the White dog house would have a temerature 42(DEG)C. Acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white.
18017	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose is stress. Why I say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time. Also she has a long essay to write along with fixing food. With all of this going on its going to cause stress on her which is causing her dreams. Since she realizes this she goes and talks to her aunt even if she wanted to hold it all inside.
26026	10	2	white ::  if the dog house was white then when it is ho t the dog house would be cooler.in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius.
6079	3	1	Both panda's and koalas are mostly the same because they've both been taught that they won't have too fight for food or find it. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because pythons eat a variety of foods, only meat. That's what they are called generalists because they eat a general variety of food.
18524	7	0	Rose feels like everything happens for a reason. Anna doesn't quite feel the same way. Anna hates that her father is gone, and Rose seems to think it was all for the better. In the article she says, 'He had to go.'
5401	3	2	Pandas and Koala's eats depend on one food source Panda's depends on bamboo. Koalas on eucalyptus. They are much different than python reason being is that pythons will eat anything that is meat.

246	1	0	The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
24478	9	1	To begin, the author introduces the topic of space junk. Then, the author describes how space junk enters Earth's orbit and poses problems by describing these occurances in chronological order; first, the satellites are introduced to Earth's orbit, then they begin to crash into each other and create microdebris, and after that point virtually nothing can be done to eliminate their threat.
27048	10	2	dark gray ::  I would use dark gray. The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer. Black had an average of 53(DEG), whereas whi te had only 42(DEG). However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice.
6140	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because the really don't as much. The panda mostly eats bamboo the Koala eats eucalyptus leaves. They are different from the python because a python swallowed a whole alligator then exploded.
11982	5	0	the four major steps are interphase, prophase, anaphase, metaphase.
8401	4	1	The word invasive is significant because its like removing a natural barrier. Not all animals were meant to go everywhere. Invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity. Sometimes, animals are meant to be kept in their environment, and not in others.
8735	4	0	In paragraph 5 the author mentions that certain animals are invasive species, meaning that they are  dangerous and probably should not be kept as pets. This goes against what the article was initially saying.
5740	3	1	"China's panda and Australia's koalas are similar because they're both specialist and favor stability as stated in paragraph 21, ""what favors specialists is stability"". They're different from pythons because they're generalist and they favor change and also stated in paper, ""what favors generalist is change""."
20316	8	2	Paul feels empathy for Mr. Leonard when he learns about Mr. Leonard's background information. Paul and Mr. Leonard were once in the same situation, except that Mr. Leonard didn't have support or help from anyone for his reading problem. In the end of the story, Paul takes Mr. Leonard to help him with his reading disability.
5313	3	1	The way the Chinease panda and the Australian koalas are alike is because they only eat one sorce of food, pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. On the other hand pythons eats mostly anything and everything it can.
26879	10	1	dark gray :: How this color might affect the dog house is that with Black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside, and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside. I chose Dark Grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather.
1346	1	2	Some additional information  would need to  know is what  samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure.
5691	3	2	Panda's in China and koalas in Australia are similar in that they can only adapt in specific places where their food is. According to the article, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves, white lizards and reptiles can live in s wide variety of places where their climate is. They can eat a wide variety of food. This sepacates pandas and koalas to be specialist and reptiles to be generalists.

23577	9	2	The author starts off with getting your attention. The author then goes into detail about launching the first satellite. The author talks about how satellites collide in to eachother and produced space debris. This debris is very troublesome because spacecrafts get damaged by this debris and it becomes very dangerous. The author finishes this article by telling the reader that space trash is on the rise.

1566	1	3	After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
17536	7	1	Anna doesn't want to hurt her families feelings by tellin them what she thinks, and that makes her seem nice.
20823	8	1	It was explaining that he was a well talented person who wanted to help another out with his talent. When he wasn't doing good in school he was being helped by some tutors that was willing to help him so that he can keep his tallent going.
1526	1	1	"After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. I have an idea how much ""one material"" is."
1206	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what samples I am using. I would need to know what size or shape of container to use. Finally, I would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container.
5069	3	1	"Pandas are both similar because on the article it talks about them being ""specialist"" and how they solely survive on one food sources. Panda has bamboo while koalas has eucalyptus.

5888	3	1	Panadas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they have setteled in their establishment because of climate and resources. ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo.'' The panda setteled there for the food that China offers. They are different because they only eat one type of food.
3952	2	1	The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
11925	5	1	The first step, as already stated, is the mRNA leaving the nucleus to be formed into a protein.  The mRNA then encounters rRNA (the ribosome), which begins reading off the codons on the mRNA to begin forming a protein.  Transfer RNA then comes with anticodons to form amino acids that form together to create the protein.

20156	8	2	Paul feels the same Mr. Leonard does,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had to given the time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.     Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too.'C'mon, Mr. leonard,' I said walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'' Paul is inspired to help out Mr. leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college, he is eager to help.It's one of the best things to do is help someone, even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks.

27348	10	2	white :: The color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black, dark gray and light gray, because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do. For example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)c while the inside tempeture of a jar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42(DEG) c. The inside of the jar with the white lid was 11(DEG)c less than the jar did with the black lid.

5476	3	2	They are similar because they are specialist that eat only one thing each panda eats bamboo and koala who eats eucalyptus leaves. Therefore they can only live in that one area that have these plants. Unlike snakes who are generalists that can live almost anywhere in the world since they do not require such specific conditions.
4929	3	1	"Pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both endangered and they eat mostly one thing, ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bears which eats almost eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.""

26145	10	1	white :: usually a dog house is only used in the summe r so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint. bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else a long with their heat. but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color s and their heat. so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42(DEG)c. the average temputure for lightgray i s 45(DEG)c, the average temp. for dark gray is 48(DEG)c, and black's av erage temp. is 53(DEG)c. thats an 11(DEG)c difference. whitch could be very important.
21112	8	2	It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard. But i also think that its gonna motivate Paul because he knows that Mr. Leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read. He also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read. So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
24683	9	2	The author organizes the article by first, grabbing our attention in an artful, playful manner (Lines 1-2). The author then goes on to explain how space junk is created, although in a much more serious manner. Once the reader is clear on the causes of 'space junk', the author goes in-depth on what happens to these unwanted fragments, in the way of collissions, and free-orbiting satellites. Eventually, the author concludes how these little pieces of 'space trash' become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel, and advises that we seek a 'viable sollution'.
17327	7	1	Rose did not want to hurt her Aunt. She doesn't like hurting people. So she wasn't going to tell her Aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family.
17209	7	2	One trait that Rose has shown is hopefulness.  Even though things are hard for her right now she isn't giving up on things.  In paragraph 23 of the text it states, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'  By listening to what her aunt had to say and stepping back to see the whole situation, Rose gained the hope that she wouldn't be stressed for long.

23869	9	1	The autor starts out with an attetion getter to make the reader want to read it. Then he goes into a sort of chronological order. He starts with what space junk is, 'What Is Space Junk,' how it is made, 'Crash Course,' and then why is can be dangerous, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' No one would know what space junk is if the author just started with why it was dangerous.
567	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this.

24327	9	2	It begins with a humorous, surprising hook, followed by explaining what 'space junk' is, after it tells readers about examples of said 'space junk', and ends with why people should care about it. The titles of the section and article, 'Orbiting Junk', 'What IS Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', do a good job at summing up what the sections and article is about.
5031	3	1	As the author said towards the end of the article both of these are specialist animals who need to remain in one area to eat the food they are accustomed to. This would not allow these species to be invasive. This is much different to the pythons because that species can adapt any change to the environment around them, unlike the specialists which do very little change.
26500	10	2	white ::  The color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees. That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white.

In the summer than the dog house will not get to warm yet it will not get to col d in the winter because it does attract some sunlight to keep it at an av erage of 48(DEG)C. That way their dog can always enjoy it's dog house no matter what the temperature is outside.
6174	3	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because they live in a hot enviorment. They both only eat one thing panda eats bambo and a koala eats eucalyptus. They are both different from pythons because you can use them as pets but a panda and a koala you can't because they are almost extinct.

Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are endangered species and they're very large, they eat alligators. Big things when pandas & koalas only eat simple leaves. Things that are absud of tree bamboo.
3269	2	2	"My conclusion based on this data is that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most in both the first and second trial. One way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing # 7 before #6. Another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment."

9575	4	2	"The term ""invasive"" gives significance in the article to show how reptiles such as pythons are expanding their habitats. For instance, the term ""invasive"" is used to prove how the Burmese python can breed in the everglades. The term ""invasive"" also hints that invasive species  could be ""major threats to biodiversity"" meaning invasive species can unbalance populations of species. This helps the author portray his beliefe that people should be careful to avoid introducing new species into environment."

Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Plastic A was  the least flexible.The first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm.Therefore out of all the plastics, plastic B had the greatest stretchability. However, one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length (mm) of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use.

5428	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both similar. They are both similar because as said in the article they are both specialist that need to inhabit certain areas because they only eat a certain food. But they are different from pythons because pythons are able to inhabit different climates and eat different foods as other generalist animals.

However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.

Mammals like a panda and a koala bear, are warm and fuzzy, while animals such as snakes and pythons, are less well respected or supported, which koala bears and pandas are different from pythons.
3684	2	1	In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.

His athletic ability got him into college but later, as a result of his lack of academic ability, he was kicked out. Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words. When Mr. Leonard told him all of this, Paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically, considering Mr. Leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles.
5655	3	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists. For example bamboo is to pandas as eucalyptus leaves is to koalas. These two species are different from snakes since a snake is a generalist species. Snakes are generalists because they can adapt to many different locations where as pandas are stuck on China and koalas are in Australia.

Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.'
3404	2	1	a) A conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps.
6783	3	1	China's panda and Australia's koala's are similar from what the eat they both survive on /plant and if the couldnt find that plant they would die unlike the python who can swallow an alligator whole as said in the article.
21454	8	2	The effect that Paul recieved from getting information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul had felt the same exact way. Paul knew what he was talking about. Since Mr. Leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles, he felt as if he should help him how to read. So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read.
23767	9	1	He puts it in very understandable terms. Instead of making it complicated and what not. He made it so that the last paragraph can sort of link on to the other one.
6691	3	1	The author of the article compares China's panda and Australia's koala bear by categorizing them as specialist animals, meaning they need to living in their natural habitat where they can find the food for their survival (for pandas; bamboo, for bears, eucalyptus leaves). A contrast to the specialist animals is the generalist animal, like the python. As the writer stated, a python has the ability to live anywhere.
5500	3	2	"Pandas in China are like koalas in Australia because they are both considered ""specialists"" as they cannot naturally live anywhere else in the world aside from China or Australia respectively due to their specific diets of ""nothing but bamboo"" and ""eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". These two animals differ from pythons because pythons have proved to be ""generalists"" as they were brought in the U.S from Asia and were still able to survive on their own despite the new habitat."
6024	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they almost eat just one kind of food all the time. They are different to pythons because they don't migrate and they don't eat animals and pythons do.
5461	3	0	Pandas are similar speals to koalas and they are both different to pythons becase pythons are not mammals and pandas and koalsas are herbivores pythons are carnivores.

In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
18655	7	1	Rose is exhausted and hard working, but also quit. Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighted down, even though she does, she didn't admit that she did.

18717	7	2	A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant. Even though she has to work a job, help around the house, and has the pressure on her to go to college, she still goes on with life and does the best she can. During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her Aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for Rose.
6538	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia both species very similar. It says in the article that pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. These animals are different from pythons because unlike pythons they don't become most abundant around humans.

It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
12650	5	1	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes to leave the cell. Once the ribosomes leave the cell through the cell membrane that is dissappearing, it goes and attaches itself to the codon strand. Once at the strand, it copies the data that will then be sent to get the anticodon strand to match up and make a protein.

I know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows, which is that the color white's average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42(DEG)C which was the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53(DEG)C which was the highest temperature (which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day, and that would be bad for the dog). So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse.

Diffusion is when molecules move from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane. Another way is by facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is when the molecules move from a low concentration to a high concentration, against the concentration gradient. This type of diffusion requires ATP. A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis. Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell. This process occurs by diffusion.

3219	2	1	Plastic type B stretched more than all other plastic types.^p One way  the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold. Another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches.
17629	7	0	Rose is some that represses her emotions, and it shows when she is talking to Anna about the money issues. Rose believes that everything will be better because of her dad working in Los Angeles. She tries to hide her emotions, and also hide what she feels by making it seem like everything is going to be okay, when she knows there is a possibilty that it won't.

6382	3	0	Koalas and panda bears in China are similar in terms of there diet. They are both herbivores that eat plants, as explained in paragraph 21. Also they are specialists who do not do best in and around humans.'' Pythons however, are generalists and thus are more abundant.
81	1	3	The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
20884	8	1	The effect the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard in the story is that Paul has the same problems Paul had but Paul is getting help with it and Paul never was interested in sports but Mr. Leonard was and he was good at them too. So since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul would help him.
5425	3	2	According to the article pandas in china eats nothing but bamboo and a koala in Australia eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves. They are similar because they both only eat one thing and they are specialists. They are different from pythons because the article states that along with rafcons, cockroachs and a white tailed deer is a generalist.
6265	3	0	"The panda and koala bears are the threats to any other animals because ""the panda and koala bears only eat bamboo or leaves."" Pythons and threats to other native animals because ""the pythons eat rats and other animals."" The animals that the python is eating will go extinct. The bears will just keep eating trees"
3985	2	2	The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.

8771	4	2	The word invasive is important to the article because it helps show how reptiles that are not typically found in the us are being brought here and are causing endangerment to US native species like the wood rat. Pythons would not be normally found in the Everglades and are invading the US and killing off our animals typically found here.
5754	3	1	A panda and a koala are both different from a python because the panda and koala are in the category of a specialist. The python is a generalist which are more favored by humans.
20990	8	0	Mr. Leonard was once in the same situation as Paul was in. It makes Paul think how far he has gotten and how much help he recieved.
3071	2	2	Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
4963	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because these animals are harmless and are not a threat to human. Pythons or the other hand are a threat to humans so they are un welcome to society as pandas and koalas are more welcomed.
20210	8	2	When reading the article, the reader first sees Mr. Leonard as a kind of mean guy, that just likes to heard people along in the hallways at schoool, because he is a hall monitor. Later on in the story when Mr. Leonard takes Paul under his wing to teach him how to be a good runner the reader learns that Mr.Leonard used to be a very succesful track runner, and used to be very well known. The reader also learns that he flunked out of college, and that's why he is no longer a runner.      Paul is a kid that can't read, and Mr. Leonard seemed to take an interest in him and was going to help him learn how to be a good runner, because he thinks it will help him out. Paul listens to Mr. Leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well. In the process of joining the high school track team Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a very well known track star. This confuses Paul on why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.     When Paul asks why he wasn't told he learns that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him because he didn't want to brag about how good he used to be, and that he was also embarrased because he had flunked out of school because he couldn't read.          The fact the Mr. Leonard took Paul under his wing to help him accomplish things in life better, and that Mr. Leonard wanted to help Paul because he never got any help tells the real type of mean Mr. Leonard is and Paul sees that and is very greatful.

These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
24471	9	1	The author first starts with the shocking realization that there is 'Space Junk' floationg in space. The author then organizes each paragraph into importance. In 'What Is Space Junk?', the author explains what the whole article is about. Then in 'Crash Course', the author explains how the debris and 'Space Junk' happen. Lastly, the author explains the importance and the REAL impact that 'Space Junk' has on the space envirioment.

3710	2	2	A. Based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type D was the most stretchable plastic type. We can make this conclusion because plastic type D stretched 20mm, the longest:farther than A (12,10mm) ,B(23,22mm) + C(14,13mm).^p B. The students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample, so it would not affect the stretching of the material. The students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type, so that they were being pulled the same amount.

17509	7	0	Rose has a trait that makes her look like she is not confident in herself. In paragraph 11 when she was talking to Anna, Rose said that 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her'. This tells you that Rose is not confident in what she says, because if she was she would have laughed like she meant it to cheer up her sister. This also means that she is not confident in what she does, because she thinks that she can not get her essay done in time and turned in. At the end of the story in paragraph 23 however Rose does get some confidence in her, and thinks of an idea for her essay.
3069	2	3	A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
1239	1	3	In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
8850	4	1	The word invasive is significant in this article. This article talks about how the increase of Burmese pythons is threatening five endangered species in the Florida keys. Also how the snakes are pulled off road ways & caring the spiecies invasive.
25998	10	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghous e because it would keep the dog cooler. White would absorb less solar and thermal energy, therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse. In the experiment, the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42(DEG) C, while the black lid jar averaged 53(DEG) C. The light g ray lid produced and air temperature of 45(DEG) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48(DEG) C.
20008	8	2	He finds out that Mr. Leonard is actually a track star, and he also can't read very well. In some ways they are very much alike, because Paul can't read very well either, but he is trained to be a great athlete. By finding out more about Mr. Leonard, Paul is able to compare himself to him in a 'role model' sort of way. Maybe with Mr. Leonard's help Paul will be inclined and encouraged to try and succeed in ways that Mr. Leonard couldn't.

Mr. Leonard helped Paul with something and now Paul will help My. Leonard in return for helping him find some confidence in something he might be good at.
23508	9	1	The author organizes this article into sections with a few new titles for each section. A couple paragraphs are in each section. It is an easy to read article.
26013	10	2	white :: White would keep the dog house cooler. White does attract heat like the color black does. When started at 24(DEG)C, t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53(DEG)C. And the white lid ded jar, which also started at 24(DEG)C, only went up to an average of 42(DEG)C.
24526	9	2	The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say.  If he didn't conduct the article this way then he would have trouble trying to meld all of his writing together such as the part about Orbiting Junk and Crash Course.  The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections.

20814	8	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star as a college freshman. However, because Mr. Leonard struggled with reading and academics, he lost his scholarship and was forced to drop out of school. The fact that Mr. Leonard also struggles academically helps Paul to relate to him. It gives Paul the confidence to embark on a friendship where he and Mr. Leanard can help each other succeed.
21697	8	2	The background information that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard changes his views. Paul finds out that Mr, Leonard has a reading disability. Paul is inspired by the information about Mr. Loenard because he to has a reading disability. Paul says, ' The emotions on his face were all to familiar to me.' The reason that the emotions are familiar to Paul is because Paul feels those exact emotions almost every day.

2957	2	2	I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out.
24533	9	1	The author first starts off by telling what the problem is. The problem is space junk. The author explains exactly what this 'junk' is. The author then gives a history of space exploration. I think that is important because it shows that after 50 years there could be a lot of junk built up. The important thing is they realize its a problem; that is explained in the last section. They're trying to find ways to solve this problem.

Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for us to go to college.' In this part of the story you can shee that she understands what she has to do so that hopefully Paul will help her get to college just like she did for him.
3429	2	2	Based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type A and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time, while plastic type C and D do not. The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.

3463	2	3	I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
2856	2	2	In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
26171	10	2	black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse. It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars, the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out. When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot, it can sleep outside.
6723	3	0	Well pandas and koalas are the same because they both are lazy and peaceful and going to instent, and they are different from the pythons because they both don't eat meat, they are not poisonose. They look diffferent, and they are not harmful.
17354	7	2	One trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with Aunt Kolab is that you can really feel what Rose is actually feeling. You can almost make a connection, with Rose and how she has to deal with life, for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her Aunt. So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too. You feel that she really cares for her family and doesn't want to upset anyone.
6695	3	2	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat certain things like plants, and python eat living creatures.

3299	2	1	A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
6369	3	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they're both specialists which means they can only survive on one special thing (bamboo or eucalyptus leaves). The article says ""A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" They're both different from pythons because pythons are generalists. Generalists can live anywhere with the assistance of technology."
2836	2	2	I have concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest and plastic A is the least stretchiest. A validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long. Another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off.
23655	9	1	The author organizes this article with an intresting introduction and later states different sections that include diffrent information for those topics.
72	1	2	"We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say ""samples"". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."
3606	2	2	Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic A is the least stretchable, and plastic B is the most. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials, which was the smallest length. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes. The students could have improved their experiment, and their results by using plastic samples of the same length, and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time.

12394	5	3	1. mRNA floats to a ribosome (rRNA) in the cytoplasm and reads three bases (codon)2. tRNA matches up with proper amino acids and then pulls its amino acids to the ribosome and lines up its anitcodons with the codons3. RNA moves forward and realeases three bases at a time and the tRNA then realeases its amino acids and drifts away.4. The amino acids bond (peptide bond) and form a chain of amino acids which is now a protein. the protein then goes and does its job in the body.
27160	10	2	black :: This color (black) may effect the inside of t he doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer. I say this becau se in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. So, I'd pick the color black if you live in a cold climate, because the black color will absorb the th e light and make the dog warmer.

Since he flunked out of college nobody wanted a runner that couldn't read. Now that Pault knows the story of someone else he can now look forward to the furture and see everything he can accomplish.
12058	5	2	After copying the DNA sequence, mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then heads to a rRNA, where synthesis can begin. The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA. Based on what three bases you have in each segment, a tRNA will bring that corresponding amino acid. The amino acids form an amino acid chain, which is also called a protein. After the mRNA has gone all the way through, the last amino acid added is the stop amino acid. After this process, all three RNAs have created a protein.

1567	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.

The flagella is a tail like attachment of a cell that allows the cell to move around.         The cell wall protects the cell and allows only specific particles in and out of it.          The cytoplasm is picky, and only allows certain materials to pass through it as well.

First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (ie grams, pounds,ouples)
6449	3	2	Pandas in China in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. This is what makes them different from pythons, because pythons are generalist species. They can live in many places, and can survive in different places because they can adapt, whereas pandas and koalas cannot.

I choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the Black lid it was 53. that is an 11(DEG)c difference between the two colors. So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite.

Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer.

6368	3	1	Pandas in china are very similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist. They also both only eat basically one type of food. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. This makes them both different from pythons because pythons are generalists and pythons eat almost anything in sight, For example an alligator.
26650	10	1	dark gray ::  This color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot.
238	1	1	The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, 2nd, say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with. If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same.
20981	8	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard never learned hwo to read, and Paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school. He connects with Mr. Leonard, as mentioned in paragraph 45, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud...' and understands who Mr. Leonard feels.     After learned about Mr. Leonard's history, Paul looks back on the days that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20334	8	2	Paul is puzzled by the information that he finds. He asks Mr. Leonard what happened and he acts concerned about it. After Mr. Leonard tells him what happened Paul realizes that this man is helping him become something he never got to become, so Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard in return and tells him to come with him to begin training. He is going to teach him how to read.
6465	3	1	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because pandas and koalas both live in a warm climate and both eat leaves mainly. Both are different from pythons because they do not feed on alligators or any animal all they eat are leaves and bamboo.

6132	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are alike. They are alike because they are both specialist. They cannot survive in locations without bamboo or eucalyptus, which they eat. If they were transported to America, they would die in our wilderness. A python is different. A python is a generalist. They can live in a larger variety of places like Asia or the southern parts of the United States. This can lead to pythons becoming invasive species, as they have no predators in their new environment. A panda cannot become an invasive species.

24065	9	2	The author organizes this article in a simple, yet effective way. They have chosen one main point, which is space junk, and created a few subtopics. By doing this, they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem.     The article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on, which is orbiting junk. Next, they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves. What is space junk? Well, after reading the second paragraph, we know what that is. After this, we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system. Last of all, we read that no matter how small the object is, it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere.      Because these smaller topics are separated from each other, the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk.

Translation occurs when tRNA makes a copy of the DNA segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mRNA strand. The complementary base pairs start to link onto the mRNA strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented. Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand.

3077	2	3	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.

Thats what made paul realized he was going though the same thing Mr. Leonard went though, and thats the bond that made paul have confadencs and wants to start training.
103	1	1	First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
18608	7	2	One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything. Although she feels so weighed down by working to help out her brother, her Aunt helps to brighten her day, saying that maybe she could help Rose out.

One of the processes is a semi permiable membrane that allows only certain substances to pass through. This membrane is like a pasta strainer. The strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in. another way cells control movement is by ATP. ATP is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement. Another way is by a cell wall. Cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell. There are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane, but these three are the most common.

5429	3	0	Pandas in China are panda's in Australia are similar because they are both specialists. Pythons are different because they are generalists unlike the specialists and things that and abundant to their locations. The bamboo and eucalyptus, generalists can eat anything mostly. This means specialists have to stay in their natural habitat, while generalists can move around and live anywhere.

The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change. Two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were.
8577	4	2	The significance of the word invasive is that these reptiles are called invasive. According to the article. Invasive species are nonnative species that are introduced to an environment and will eat  indigenous species. Because the another are proliferating and hunting native specie. Populations, they are invasive. Also, MacInnes thinks that invasive is an unfair term, and that the species are instead introduced rather than invading the new environment.

5508	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both exclusive to the place they live. You won't find pandas anywhere but China, same with koalas in Australia. This is different from pythons because the article said pythons can live anywhere from California to Delaware , any place with a climate similar to their original Asian habitat.
8379	4	2	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the article because the government believes that the reptiles are an invasive species, and thus pose a threat, however, MacInnes that the term is unfair. he says they are ""introduced"" and are less of a threat than the government thinks. Biologists say that these invasive (or ""introduced"") species are major threats to biodiversity ans cause complications. The article implies that we should be more careful to avoid introducing invasive species, especially in Florida."

562	1	1	There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
5258	3	0	"pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are becoming extinct this is different because pythons are becoming more popular because in paragraph 3 it says "" The pet increasing estimates that 4.8 million households now contain one or more reptiles, a number that nearly doubled in a decade."

5440	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia, because their both specialist and they both stick to one main food. Pandas rely on bamboo and Koalas rely on eucalyptus leaves. They are diff from pythons because pythons are all over the world while pandas and koalas are in one place, also because a python is a snake and a generalists, while pandas and koalas are not.
24474	9	2	The author organizes the article by breaking it down in four sections. Each section is a a little more detailed and serious than the last. Section one is the explaination of the story. Section two talks about what space junk is. Section three explains the dangers of orbiting satellites and section four explains the way scientists are trying to find solutions to the space junk problem.      Sections one is the introductory it grabs the readers attention and keeps them interested. Section two describles a little bit about the history of space exploration. It also explains what happens to satellites over time when they are orbiting in space for a long period.      Section three explains the dangers of satellites crashing in outerspace. It also gives an example of two satellites colliding with one another and spreading tiny debris all over space. Section four explains the seriousness of this debris and explains what NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to do.      In each of these paragraphs it explains the importance of cleaning up our space system. I have learned that space is a dangerous and sometimes life threatening place.

20191	8	1	When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard struggled with the work required of him in high school and college, he feels immediately sympathetic toward the hall monitor because of his similar situation. In my opinion, he most likely felt more of a connection with the older man at this point, and he realized at last why Mr. Leonard was so determined to coach him in track after school. As is usually the case with students and their teachers, Paul is probably also somewhat surprised to discover that Mr. Leonard has had his own difficulties in life.     However, Mr. Leonard's story also has another effect on Paul - It encourages him to work harder so he doesn't suffer the same fate. After this, Paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes. After being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesn't do so, he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like Mr. Leonard has.     Paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school, which he took for granted in the past. Although he initially viewed it as something to be embarrassed about, he most likely is now thankful that he has people to assist him and motivate him when Mr. Leonard didn't have the same luxury.

In the story, Paul not only learns about Mr. Leonard's past as a track 'star', but also about his stuggles with learning. This information motivates Paul because he realizes that he has more opprotunities than Mr. Leonard ever did and that even though Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, his school work was more important; grades really do matter.      This information also helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard and him share a connection. Through this connection, they can both help each other out.

Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.

Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leave which both are plants. a python will even attempt to eat an alligator which can be seen in pictures.
17755	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is maturity. Rose is very mature for her age. Rose gets out of school, goes strait to work for a four hour shift, comes home to help her Aunt with dinner, and then tries to find time to complete all of her homework. Rose does all of these things and is always busy because she wants to help out her family who came to america from Cambodia. Rose also shows her maturity in her conversation with Anna, although Anna says she misses her dad and that money isn't everything while Rose says that they need the money, and they are just doing what is neccisary to support the family and put both of the girls in college.

Only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read.     Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school.
3592	2	1	My conclusion for this experiment is that if plastic B is used than it will be able to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weights. The reason I know this is because in trial 1 and 2 it had the leading length. A way that this experiment could have been improved would be by not putting the weights on at the same time. This would allow for the bags to get use to each weight. Another thing could be to make sure all the plastics are equal in measurement because that can ruin the data.

3935	2	2	In conclusion, our hypothesis was widing because plastic type B stretched the most instead of plastic type C. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes.
8093	4	2	"The word, ""invasive"" plays a very important role in the article. Biologists, such as Skip Snow claim that these reptilian species of pythons and lizards are ""invasive"". This conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems. However, some such as RobRay MacInnes, argue otherwise, ""Invasive is the rod of the controversy over these reptiles."

3524	2	1	Based on the students data, I can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment, plastic type A stretched the longest with 2mm, and type D stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp. Another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type A,B,C and D.

20852	8	2	After Paul researched the background information about Mr.Leonard, he becomes exstatic and excited to be in the precence of a leagend. This is evident when Paul asked why Mr.Leonard had not told him about his acomplishments. This is also evident from the excited way the say that 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nations. You broke records.'
21617	8	2	Paul sees that Mr. Leonard did him a kindness in teaching him how to run and jump, especially as Paul is someone who is chosen last in gym, and Mr. Leonard was one of the best college track stars.  Paul wants to repay Mr. Leonard's kindness by helping teach him as Paul learns.  Paul and Mr. Leonard have a learning disability in common which helped give Paul the motivation to help someone like him out.
5135	3	1	Both panda's and Australia's koalas are similar. They both tend to only eat one food, being bamboo for panda's and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. They are also both specialists. Unlike pythons which are generalists. Also, pythons can tend to live in any enviornment, where koala's and panda's are mainly found in China and Australia. Koalas are similar to pandas, when they are both different to pythons.
3913	2	2	"A) From the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic type A stretched the most as compared to plastics type B,C,D because from ""T2"" it started at 10 and to T2 it went to 12. Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type ""A it stretched 2mm"". ^p B0 The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials so they could get better and more precise results. They could also be more specific about the weights and tell us what to start with, small weights and then gradually get to heavier ones or use all the same."

20419	8	2	The background information gives Paul a sense of connection with Mr. Leonard. This connection rises from the fact that they both struggle with reading. Mr. Leonard became interested in him because he discovered that Paul had to take special classes to improve his reading while Mr. Leonard never got that help. After Paul joined the track team and found why Mr. Leonard stopped running track he found a way he could repay Mr. Leonard for training him in hurdles by 'training' him in how to read well. The ending creates a good give-take relationship.

3787	2	2	A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid.

As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
6605	3	1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat one specific thing. They differ from pythons because pythons can eat a wide array of different animals and aren't picky like Koalas and Pandas.

He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him.
8141	4	1	The significance of the word invasive is mainly that they intrude into the society. The article talks about species coming in contact with each other eventually, but whom the natural borders are taken away and the animals are foreely put there, then they invade another society or community hence invasive.

5310	3	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are different from pythons because they need specific things to survive. The pandas eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Koala bear only eats eucalyptus leaves. This means that these animals are very exclusive. But a python can adapt almost where the climate is right. For example it can even adapt herein the U.S. The difference is that a python is a generalist and Koalas and Pandas are specialists.
21444	8	2	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he was so amazed that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles and didn't tell him about it.  The effect really sinks into to Paul that Mr. Leonard was just like him.

Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other. However, you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed. If the doghouse should be placed outdo ors, black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold wint ers. If placed indoors, the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm.

Then, the author goes on to explain exactly what space junk is. In this section, the reader also learns some background information, such as, 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.' The passage is concluded by explaining how important the topic of space junk is.

Evidence to prove so is ""China's panda eat's almost nothing but bamboo. Australia's koala bear eats's eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively"". This indicates that do share similarities, but also differ from python, in that the python can eat almost and adapt to conditions similar to its an."
27545	10	1	white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.

4051	2	3	Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most. Plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched. Also they should of used the same amount of weights.
24601	9	1	The author organizes this article from explaing what space junk is ,to how harmful it can be and the damge it can do .From the First paragraph it explains what has cause all the space junk and how things have just piled up over the past 52 years and now how it is out of hand and has to be dealt with before bad things happen.
27142	10	0	white :: WHite dosent absorb much energy compared to b lack. black absorbs the energy like crazy
26414	10	2	dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be b est to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives, b ut not overly heated in the summer. In the experiment, the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48(DEG). A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog. In the investi gation, the air temperature of black was at 53(DEG). The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog. The air temperatures of the light g ray was 45(DEG) and of the white was 42(DEG). This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse.

When Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard could not ready, just like him, he felt like they had a lot more in common with each other.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.  I knew them well --feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  This shows that Paul is very apreciative that Mr. Leonard is showing interest in him, and it motivates him to do well in school so that he can succeed in college.

4991	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they can only survive in very special climates with specific food sources. These are different from pythons because pythons can adapt better and eat many different things. This is shown in the map provided with the article because it shows pythons could survive in 17 states.
26508	10	1	white :: it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time

599	1	2	Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.
27499	10	1	black ::  the darker the color the greater the increase in the air temperature in the dog house because darker colors absorb mor e energy.
3345	2	3	A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
3501	2	2	Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight.
1600	1	1	The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
589	1	2	The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals.
24077	9	2	In this selection the author organizes his/her main points into sections that relate and flow from one to the other. For example, he/she use the transition form the main title 'Orbiting Junk,' to 'What is Space Junk.' These sections describe what 'space junk' is. Then he/she transition into the dangfers of 'space junck,' by using titles such as 'Crash Course,' which transitions into 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites. The author organized his/her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next.
3943	2	2	I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
3635	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.

To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
16977	7	2	From her conversations, Rose seems to be a caring individual, in the way that she tried to comfort Anna and in her kind and gentle behavior towards Aunt Kolab when asked if this lifestyle was difficult. She cares about her family enough to work a job to help support the family and send her brother to college and seems to be caring enough to help carry the entire family.
3235	2	1	The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.

5035	3	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar for they are both specialists species, meaning that they are stable creatures who live the same lifestyle. For example they eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves respectively. They both are different from the python because the python is a generalist species. That means that it is able to adapt to changes. It can eat a variety of things, it can change.

Paul goes on to explain that he understands the feelings of embarrassment Mr. Leonard felt because he had felt them himself.
18617	7	0	She worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now. She talked to Anna about they had a part to do, so that they could go to college. Aunt Kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do. Rose said that she does worry about it.
26684	10	2	black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
27306	10	2	white :: White would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42(DEG)C. This would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would .
6157	3	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because all they do is eat all day. And their different from pythons because pythons are a much more dangerous animal. In the story it says in the Everglades in 2005: a python swallowed an alligator: now you don't hear news about pandas or koalas swalling an alligator.
6619	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists which relies on specific food sources and would not be able to survive in most other places in the world. The article states, ''China's panda (eats) almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively'' to show that these animals could not live anywhere in contrast, pythons are generalists which can live anywhere. These organisms are becoming more abundant, as compared to specialists because they favor change.
21030	8	2	When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star he wonders why he isn't anymore.

27027	10	1	black :: black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors.
3128	2	2	A. My hypothesis was correct plastic type 'A' stretched the least during the experiment. I noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items. ^P B. To improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.

3295	2	3	In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
20049	8	1	After Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's background, it shows him that someone can related to him. Paragraph 45 shows that they both had the same sort of problems that they had to overcome and face. Also Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard the same way Mr. Leonard had helped him.
3533	2	2	A. Based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type B because it was stretched out the  furthest, then the next most stretchy was D, then C, then the least was A. ^p B. Two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being added to the plastics and for T2 I believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types.

He tells of the variety as well. Next, he points out the danger of dead satellite collisions ,and again specifies some of the reasons that such debri occur in space. He goes on to make sure that all realize that this is dangerous to themselves so that they do not blatantly disregard the article. He emphasizes the danger of small particles at high speeds to those on earth and those in space. He also writes of the increase in space junk that is occurring due to commercial space travel. He also reveals the hope that corporations and nations have to come up with viable solutions to space pollution.

5849	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat one type of food. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because pythons can eat just about anything because when it went to a new habitat, it didn't die. This is because it didn't need food it had from old habitat to survive.
3380	2	2	a) After viewing the data, it is clear that type B has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, compared to type A's 10 mm and 12 mm. Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. This will give him more control over the experiment. Also, he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to. The control should be either stretchable or very durable.

21146	8	1	Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles.

Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data. ^p In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and, increasing its size.
15501	6	0	Active transport:  It is used by the cell membrane to transfer items throughout the cells.  The cell membrane decides if the items can pass through the cell or not.  Distribution: The cell membrane will also use distribution to decide what items go to each part of the cell and how much will be sent to the organelles.  These items could be things like water or other fluids.Seperation: The cell membrane can decide at any time what to seperate in a cell or out of the cell.  It can split up ribosomes or keep fluids from entering the cell.  The cell membrane is the main protector of the cell.
3978	2	2	Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.

One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
60	1	3	To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
6742	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both considered specialists. They both eat a singular plant (Panda eats bamboo, koala eats eucalyptus leaves).

The black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C which is too hot for a dog in the summer. it needs to be at a rela xing temperature which is 45(DEG)C for the light gray. If i were to choo se the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in. The light gr ay color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his l ittle house.
6685	3	1	Pandas and koalas are very similar, they are both specialist species. ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia's koala bear.'' A python is a generalist they can live anywhere and be fine and create a home, unlike the pandas and koalas.

3826	2	3	Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly.

23202	9	2	The author organizes the article very well. He starts off with a great introduction that has the ability to catch the reader's attention. He then tells us what space junk is, as well as provides us with reasons why sending objects into space. We send capsules, telescopes, and satellites into space because they do so much for us; they monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless communcation possible.               In the next paragraph we read about crash courses. Having read the article before it, we know why this can be a terrible occurence. The following paragraph, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', gives us more evidence that space debris can be a very serious problem. So at the end of reading the article we've been informed in a good order about 'Orbiting Junk'.
26292	10	0	light gray ::  Black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45(DEG) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53(DEG) w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog.

5615	3	2	Pandas and koala bears are similar because they both seem to eat one thing only which is for example bamboo and for koalas eucalyptus leaves. Also they are both specialists. They are different from pythons because a python is a generalist and it can eat a variety of animals.
6460	3	2	Pandas in China only eat bamboo which is only found in certain Asian countrys. Koala bears in Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves which are only found in few parts of the world. If you take a panda or koala out of it's habitat then it won't survive unlike pythons which eat mice which are found anywhere.

Paul then finds out that Mr. Leonard was kicked out of college and cound't get into another one because he couldn't read.
3321	2	2	The conclusion that I have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type B was able to stretch the most. One way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability. The student also could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment.

11254	5	1	After the mRNA leave the nucleus it goes off into the cytoplasm and proteins connect to the mRNA strand. After this happens they convert the mRNA to amino acids and it goes down the strand one by one till it reaches the stop codon. After this point it gets copied into a rRNA strand. Lastly it then gets carried to other places in the body that need to know the RNA combinations so they can make DNA in the next cell with mitosis occurs.
12680	5	2	1.  The DNA unzips and is copied to create mRNA which can then leave the nucleus because it is single stranded.2. After leaving the Nucleus, the mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome.3. The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences. The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4. After a second tRNA is attached, the aminoacids form a phosphate bond with eachother and the first tRNA is ejected to recieve another Amino acids. This step repeats until the protein is complete, the stop codon is reached, and a the last amino acid breaks from the last tRNA

The effect of this information is that when Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track, Paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when Mr. Leonard tells him to do something. Later, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college, and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader. Paul's learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and Mr. Leonard are not all that different. Paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center, and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to Mr. Leonard. Paul's newfound knowledge of Mr.Leonard's background evokes this generosity.

9319	4	2	Invasive species refer to animals/species that was introduced to an area it did originally live in. This means that other animals,spreading endangered species, will not be introduced to having them there. According to the article, pythons are endangering five species in the Florida in US. This is because they are not used to having pythons there.

The second section explains the process of how satellites crash into eachother.  It gives an example of when Earth and Russia's satellites crashed and how they were completely disabled and useless, making them 'space junk'.  Lastly, the third section tells the aftermath.  It talks about the microscopic particles and how they are hard to detect even with our technology.

Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything.
6154	3	1	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia Because they both have a single food source; bamboo and eucalyptus respectively, that is not prevalent around the world, so must live in a certain area.

It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites. The risks and dangers are further explained in, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal, it can still cause a lot of damage. It gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage. It concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem.

17353	7	1	Rose is very responsible. She spends her days at school, then going to work, then preparing supper, and then doing homework. She is dutiful because she is trying to prepare for her future at college and helping Paul pay for his.
9456	4	0	"The significance of the them saying invasive, is beacuse some people think that there animals invading their states when they are really don't explosing, and like MacInnes states, ""even the term invasive is unfair. They're introduced, in that that invasive is passing judgements')."
12481	5	0	The mRNA gets transformed into another type of RNA. That new RNA is use to make genetic information. That strand of genetic information gets a complementary strand. Both of the strands get paired up and they make a segment of DNA.
24667	9	1	The author organizes the article in different ways. such as What is Space Junk talks about all of the different things that do get sent out and lost or 'dies'. Crash course talks about how the dead satellites run into eachother.Also Little bits, But its a big deal explains that even though they can be little bitty pieces of the 'space junk' they do matter.
21689	8	2	Paul knows how it feels to be rejected and embarrased. and he wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
6146	3	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists. Both of these single out one type of food and only eat that. They are different from a python because pythons are generalists. Pythons are more dangerous and eat almost anything. It can live in different cultures and climates than the specialists.
532	1	2	The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
5845	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only eat 1 certain food. For example pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because they eat anything and can live anywhere where there is cold climate

8424	4	0	Invasive is a very si gnificant word in this article. The article is talking about harmful animals and  also how some people consider some animals to be pets and others to be invasive.
12479	5	0	The first step is that the protien unzips the mRNA. The next step is that it takes out any kind of trash that it may have. Next the protien comes back and Zips it back up. The last step is that it sends it back from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
3923	2	2	A good conclusion I can make from the data is type A and C were the most alike and types B and D were the most alike. For example for T1 type A had 10 and type C had 14 and for T2 type B had 22 and type D had 20. The student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were.

23015	9	0	The author starts off in a more simple, easy going way so that the reader can connect and understand what their talking about.  Next it changes to a more serious tone so that the reader understands the seriousness of space junk and the dangers that it holds.  The author uses examples such as 'Satellite 33442' to prove differnt times its happened in history.
6568	3	1	the author describes pandas and koala bears as specialists while pythons are generalists. Both pandas and koalas eat one food exclusively. Pandas eat bamboo and koala bears eat eucalyptus. Pythons however, can eat nearly anything and are capable of surviving in more than one place. Pandas and koala bears must remain where they can get the right food.

9605	4	1	The word invasive is significant to the rest of the article because it's the perfect word to describe what is taking place. Invasive means to inhabit an area that you are not originally native to. In the article, the Burmese python has spread to places that are unusual for it being. Invasive species can ruin the biodiversity in other areas.
20290	8	1	The track coach ask paul where he has been training, Paul tells him that it was Mr. Leonard.When Paul shows Mr. Leonard a picture of him when he was in school paul asks him what happened to him that he failed school. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard couldn't read he didn't feel that bad because he also couldn't read.
9078	4	1	"As MacInnes said in the article, the species are ""introduced"". Invasive species are organisms that are introduced to areas where they have never lived in before. However, people consider them invasive since, normally, the species that are introduced end up tipping the natural balance of life in that environment."
3183	2	1	My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
17796	7	1	Hard working. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.
21296	8	2	The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
17822	7	0	That she is real open but hessitent to to say what she really wants to, because she doesn't want to hurt aunt if she tells the truth.
18145	7	0	Rose is stumped on if she could squeeze in the essay or not, and that if she tries then she'll be even more packed than what she already is with trying to help out her family already. Rose feels like she is doing her best, but that it also might not be enough. She doesn't really want to tell anyone about her problems either because they might make their problems a little bit more worse.     Aunt Kolab said, with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
21405	8	0	From the stroy Paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading. In a simmular background Mr. Leonard was a excelling Track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels. From Mr. Leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures.
6327	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat plants. They are both different from pythons because pandas and koalas are not snakes and are not deadly animals and they are not reptiles.

5539	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both have one major source of food to rely on. They are both different from a python because a python is a carnivore while pandas and koalas are herbivores.
3673	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. ^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial. Another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time.
13988	6	0	Cells use the process of diffusion to take in the substances. The protiens in the plasma membrane change their shape to carry substances throught the membrane and into the cell. Osmosis also brings substances into the cell by bringing them in through the water around the cell.

26932	10	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is white. This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat. The dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house. After 10 minutes of heat from the lamp, the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. But the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. The white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot, moisty and sweaty.

23163	9	1	He starts the article by telling us what space junk is and what the cause is. He then tells us of the darngers and consaquences of the space junk.
27436	10	2	white :: Assuming that the location of the doghouse ha s a warm climate, the white paint color will be more likely to keep the t emperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler, or lower, temperat ure. This can be said because the white paint color, on average, made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42(DEG) C, compared to 53(DEG) C for black paint, 48(DEG) C for dark gray paint, and 45(DEG) C for light gr ay paint. It is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so th at the dog, that stays inside the doghouse, doesn't overheat.
11260	5	1	It then enters the ribosome in which it meets the tRNA and is then creating an even bigger strain of nucleic acid.
3424	2	1	After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
205	1	2	In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours.
1232	1	2	Additional information that you would need to repeat this experiment would be one: how much vinegar is added to each separate container. Two, how much of each sample is added to each cup. Three, what you are measuring the weight in. Four, what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours.
3510	2	2	a) Each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one, so it, poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic.^p b) The student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere.

17718	7	1	Rose has a maternal trait.  This has been shown through her conversation with her sister Anna.  For example when she speaks to Anna the author says she uses a gentle voice.
5170	3	1	The pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. A specialist species is one that cannot adapt to the other conditions. Generalists on the other hand, ca adpt to other conditions & climates. Pandas & koalas are specialist species & they cannot adapt but pythons are generalist & they can live anywhere.
11545	5	1	First, mRNA takes the codes to the ribosome to make the proteins. Then, the rRNA codes for the proteins and makes them. Then the tRNA transfers the proteins back to the nucleus. Finally, the proteins are released into the cytoplasm, and the process begins again.
20439	8	0	The effect on Paul made him realize that Mr. Leonard knows what he is going through. The text in the story said, 'I relied on friends to me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'
20675	8	0	He feels sorry for Paul for having struggles with reading because My. Leanard knows exactly how it felt to succeed so well at something but in the same aspect he was not a good student and no school wanted an athlete who could not read. He did not want Paul to go through the same expierience he did with being so talented, but the difficulties with reading held him back from being able to do what he was good at.
23053	9	2	He first starts out with the introduction to be interesting, to get your attention. Then he slows down by talking about how dangerous this 'space junk' can be. Then he talks in order of stuff that goes on in outer space. He keeps it simple, but also interesting for the readers. He explains what goes on that we don't know and that we don't think goes on.
17374	7	0	she is a busy body, cause she always has stuff to do.
20810	8	2	He learns that Mr. Leonard is very much like him in the sense that Mr. Leonard isn't a good reader either.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track, even though he was not that good in school.  When he explained to Paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college, it helped Paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school, but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal.  With Mr. Leonard showing Paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles, Paul was able to apply Mr. Leonard's advice to his own life.
11616	5	1	First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus. When it enters the cytoplasm, the ribosomes meet up with it and it begins protein synthesis. The tRNA matches up with it, and the amino acids are formed. After the opposite strand is made, they break apart and you have a strand of amino acids.

18367	7	2	Rose is very hard working and caring.  She believes that when you help someone, they will help you in return.  When Rose is having a conversation with her sister, Anna, Rose states, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'       Rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has.  She is a very dedicated lady, who seems to find success in a lot of different situations throughout her life.

21380	8	2	I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
3859	2	0	a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.

5355	3	1	China's panda bears and Australian koala bears are similar because they are not really a part of the food chain. Pandas just eat bamboo while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons, because pythons will eat whatever they can find weather its a rat, a bird, or even a crocidile. Pythons are able to alter an ecosystem.
12325	5	1	They go through transcription. The dna splits into to so it unwinds its self and splits. Now its mRNA and it has to split to fit through the passage way out of the nucleus.

In the Crash Course section she talks about satellites and how they have failed to work before and how that affects things. In the last section she explains why that space junk is harmful and what it does for space exploration.
14316	6	0	One way they try carry the substances across the cell membrance is that the cells will go through a special kind of door that only allows a certain kind of substance in.Another way is that the special exits that let out a certain kind of substance.And finally, the third one, the way that they are moved into the cell through a door that allows both subtances into the cell.
18464	7	0	Rose did not want to hurt her family by telling her aunt that she felt weighed down by helping them so much. She did not answer her aunt's question because she knew that the truth would hurt her aunt and her mother.
868	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.

6070	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia is that they are both specialist that eat almost nothing except plants. Meanwhile a python which is a generalist is a carnivorous animal. For example, in the article it talks about how a python had tried swallowed a crocodile but instead exploded.
3751	2	3	A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.

The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
8687	4	0	Invasive I think means that these animals are starting to let themselves be known around the world. MacInnes believes that the word is unfair and that it should be changed to introduced.
3257	2	1	a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
2943	2	3	A. Based on the students date, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible at all the samples. ^p B. To improve their experimental design, the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add.
8877	4	0	Invasive essentially means invading something. For example, invading someones home by unwanted visitors or invading privacy is invasive.

Next comes the beginning statement, the sentence that tells the audiance what the writer is writing about and where they stand. After that, you have the body, which, in this case, is made up of the history of space travel, the information of how much and what makes up the debris, and finally, the impact it has on our space explorers. After these statements, comes the closure of the article, giving all of the well rounded information that it is steadily increasing.

She is willing to devote what seems to be the vast majority of her free time towards helping out her family and setting them up for a more enjoyable future. The day that is described early in the story included zero downtime for her. She went from school, straight to her work, and then right back home to help her aunt. When she finished those tasks, she had to attempt to complete her homework assignment while fighting exhaustion.

11425	5	1	mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it is copied into rRNA and tRNA carrying an amino acid attatch to the nucleic acid in segments of three. The tRNA attatches to certain nucliotide sequences that code for the protein attatched to it and then body form between the amino acids as more tRNA come and once the bond forms between the amino acid the tRNA is let go. By the end of the RNA chain a long string of amino acids has been created
11872	5	3	1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.

Paul, on the other hand, has been giving the opportunity to learn to read. Because of the schools learning center, Paul has a tutor to help with his reading. Mr. Leonard didn't have the chance to have a tutor until he was in college. By the time Mr. Leonard was in college it was too late, the classes were too hard. Mr. Leonard flunked out of school, so he was never able to take his skill for running any father. This effects Paul because he will be able to go to college and do things with the skills Mr. Leonard has taught him.

'What is Space Junk,' tells about what it is and how long it has been up there and when they figured out what it was. The section 'Crash Course,' tells about how the little particles in space can damage the satellites even if they are small pieces. The last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' tells about what the fragments can do to a satellite. It also tells how the spacecraft is designed to try to avoid the little particles, but sometimes can not avoid them all. This article explains what 'Space Junk' is and how it affects the satellites, it also explains how much damage something so little can do.

The 'What is Space Junk?' section explains how space capsules, satellites, and teloscopes explore space. This section also explains how sometimes they can collide and go into uncontrolled orbit aroung the Earth. The 'Crash Course' section explains how the dead satellites orbit around the Earth and great speed and then crash into each other causing pieces from them to break off and sometimes go into Earth. The 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section explains how something no smaller than the size of a baseball can not be indentified on a radar, which makes it harder to a spacecraft to avoid those objects.

During her conversastion with Anna, Rose explains that Papa had to go to Los Angelos so that he can support the family.  She understands what he had to give up to go work there, and she knows that he is doing it for the good of the family.  Rose also understands that she needs to keep her job. in order to help support the family.  She understands that even if she does win the essay contest she will not be able to travel to Sacramanteo.  She cannot attend because she is willing to work to keep her job.

Then, when he has deemed that the readers understand, he gives examples of how this space junk is affecting us. Such as how when dead satellites are left in space, they run the risk of colliding with each other. Finally, the author brings home the point that space junk is very dangerous. He explains that while the objects may be small, when at extreme speed such as in space, they could do a lot of damage.

It."
3038	2	3	One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.

3403	2	1	The conclusion
4990	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both rely on only a certain type of food and can only survive in their natural habitat where that food is available. They are both different from pythons, because unlike pandas & koalas, pythons can survive in many different environments and they are not picky when it comes to eating.
17465	7	0	Rose thinks that there is something wrong with Anna.
6135	3	2	The Chinese panda and Australian koalas are similar species. They are both specialist animals, and they both have something in ther homeland which need to survive that desert grow anywhere else. Python are a generalist species so they can adapt to places that are not ther homeland.
21307	8	1	He has always looked up to Mr. Leonard, so when he found out all the things that had happen to himin college, i think at first he was shocked but then he heard more. Paul had kind of realized that Mr. leonard was like him when he was his age. I just think it make Paul and Mr. Leonard closer.
6130	3	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. This means that they can only survive in one type of habitat, because for example the panda only eats bamboo and the Koala only eats eucalyptus leaves the python, however is a generalist species. So it can live in a wide variety of places, such as Asia and the U.S.

Rose steps in and momentarily becomes a parental figure in this situation, attempting to comfort her sister in this difficult time.     She is also protrayed as very realistic.  This family is going through a lot and it is very understandable that Rose is stressed out over some of the things going on.  This is made clear during her conversation with Aunt Kolab, where she confesses about all the stress she is going through to her Aunt and talks everything out.

Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants.
163	1	1	You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples.

248	1	1	First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.

Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
5126	3	1	Pandas in China are the same as koalas in Australia because these two species don't have anywhere else on the earth than these two places. They are both different from pythons because as stated in paragraph 20, they can live in more places than one on the earth than pandas and koalas.

925	1	1	In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.

12399	5	2	After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome. The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon. Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid. More and more tRNA molecules bring anticodons to the mRNA codons, which produce a growing polypeptide chain. This chain will be a protein.

Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
24743	9	2	The author seperates the article into different parts. There are four main parts. There are three main parts each with a different topic on space junk.     In the first the author uses a humerous appraoch like, 'It's a... tool bag?' but then moves to a more serious tone. The author explains that it is a serious issue.     the author presents the dangers and problems in the later sections. Finally, at the end he says how many nations contribute to the problem and it must be solved. So first he gets your attention, then the next section explains what it is, and the last two present the issues and the seriousness of it while concluding the paper.

14439	6	3	Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.
3545	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched the most plastic type A was stretched the last.I think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did.

21694	8	2	Paul finds out, like him, Mr. Leonard cannot read but can run track. Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard had done for him by making him happy with doing track and decidesto teach him how to read because he understarnds the embarassment of not knowing how.      The story states, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddently I realized what I could do for him.' This shows that Paul wanted to thank him in some way, and that way was teaching him to read.
20730	8	1	Paul understood better why Mr. Leonard took care of Paul. When Paul told Mr. Leonard he couldn't read, that was a sign right there that he was going to look after him and make him a star. With this back ground information, Paul felt more emotionally connected to Mr. Leonard because he went through the exact same things in his life. He felt like there was someone else out there, and this man was just trying to help Paul succeed at something.

He then has paragraphs explaining what space junk is and a history of space junk. The author uses his next few paragraphs to tell about a real life story that occurred due to this topic. This story occurred in Februaru 2009 when two communication satellites crashed creating more debris. He does this to show the reader that this truly does have a large impact. His next paragraph is used to compare space junk to objects in real life which will help the reader understand better. The author then explains what people are doing to overcome this challenge such as adding walls to spacecrafts. The last paragraph is the conclusion which is used to sum up what was said and to state that space agencies hope to come up with a sollution.

Then he or she states that even though after crashes in space and all the little pieces of the satelillets can still harm the earth, because of how much speed is being increased.
20714	8	2	When Mr. Leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him, because he was a good coach to him. Paul felt the same when Mr. Leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read, so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track.
20786	8	0	The background information helps Paul acheive his goals. Paul took his training lessons from Mr. Leonard and became good at doing the hurdles in track. Even though Paul couldn't read he still wanted to do few things to accomplish in his life. He may of been going into the Learning Center but that doesn't stop you from doing well in other acheivements. Paul learned alot from his coach and taught him how to be better than what Paul had realized he was.
4979	3	2	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because they are both special lists. This means that they only eat specific items, such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. The python, on the other hand, is a generalist carnivor that will eat any meat.

Certain molecules must become attached to the passage for the molecule to pass through. Also the cellmembrane itself does not allow  molecules to go through it unless they have the right structure for it to go through.They must diffuse across the membrane.
5015	3	2	Both pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they they are specialist. This means that they would not be able to survive anywhere else because the certain food sources they need are only incaled in China and Australia. A python , a generalist is different because it can live anywhere on earth, as long as it has a climate that is suitable.
5324	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both part of the specialist species. A panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and a koala eats almost nothing but eucalyptus leaves. Because of this, they differ from pythons which are part of the generalist species. Pythons can live in many places and they do well around humans.
24632	9	2	The author starts off with an exciting introduction, that very much grabbed my attention. Next, he or she defines Space Junk. Third, the author discusses how satellites collide with each other. Lastly, he or she talks about small issues that are a big deal.
9302	4	1	The word invasive signifies invading or conquering. The article uses this word, invasive, to describe those reptile species such as the python and the Nile monitor lizard who are capable of adapting and reproduce, and have quickly began to invade or dominant those habitats in which they were once foreign to such as the Everglades National Park.
5311	3	2	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist. They both usually only eat one kind of food: bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. If these animals were taken from their food source chances are they would die. This is not like pythons, however pythons when given a mild to warm climate to live in, will adapt to the in surrounding and food would not a factor, As long as there are animals in their environment, pythons will have food. However pythons for the moment are not suitable fro colder climates.
21015	8	1	he understands how Mr. Leonard feels about it because he has the same problem, and it brings Paul closer to Mr. Leonard because he now understands him more
6719	3	1	"Both pandas and koalas are specialists. Pythons are generalists. "" What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability."" This justs state that the difference is that the pandas and koalas need a stable environment with stable foods while the pythons prefers to be in an environment which is always changing."

23474	9	2	The author organizes the article in a way that will be most familiar to someone that is reading it. The way he/she starts with the classic super man introduction and then leads off into explaining what this thing really is, is a great organization method that most people are familiar with. Another great example of the authors organizational skills is when he/she gos from describing satellite crashes to the effects that the debris from said crashes can cause.
20446	8	2	The effect, on Paul, about discovering the background information on Mr. Leonard is empathy. Paul understands exactly how Mr. Leonard feels, 'embarrassed.' Paul feels led, that sinse his coach had taken such an interest in him and took time to help him overcome his obstacles, that he should return the favor and help excel Mr. Leonard with his disability.
21022	8	1	I think that it helps him alot because he now knows that the coach was ding what he knew trying to help the kid on something that he could not accomplish himself.
26895	10	1	light gray ::  The color light gray would have to be the be st color to paint the doghouse. They wouldnt want to use black because si nce black is a dark color itll absorb more energy &amp; make the air temp erature rise high. So black wouldnt be a good color because they wouldnt want the dogs to get to hot. That is why i chose light gray because i thi nk its just righ to paint the doghouse. With light gray, the dogs wouldnt be to hot or too cold. They would be just right.

2986	2	3	The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
3263	2	2	Based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data. Two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data.

But then it's changed back to its original state and paired with anti-codons that are attached to amino acids. The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains. Once the anti-codons reach the stop codon, the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein.

The python is considered invasive to the Florida Everglades since they are eating 5 endangered species and have been growing in number. The pythons are causing problems for wildlife biologist skip snow who drags pythons off roods & from under roods."
3910	2	3	Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
9300	4	0	The significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article is that it make the reptiles not seem so bad. The whole article is all about negatives on pythons and other reptiles.

3788	2	2	My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
6023	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because both the Panda and Koala only really have one source of food. The Panda eats bamboo and the Koala eats eucalyptus leaves.

20885	8	2	The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did.

The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached.

21092	8	2	I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.

Then talks about all the different space crafts used in the past 52 years.          Following that, the next catagory is 'Crash Course' he talks about what could go wrong with satallites. Also, about how America and Russian satellites crashed into eachother right about earth. Because of this crash their are Hundreds of millions pieces of satellite in space now.     The next Category is called 'Little Bits,  But a Big Deal'in these few paragraphs he is basically saying that as much as we would like to think that this isn't a big deal, it actually is. It can even distory spaceships. I think that this is a very organized article. He plans out the paper very well.

9132	4	0	The significance of the word invasive is that inasive is passing judgement. This word relates to the story because if letting the reader know that these species are very dangrous. Also feet them in on how life is speeding up big time.
26219	10	2	white :: I think they should paint the color white, be cause white absorbs less heat than black does. Because if Black, Dark gra y, or Light gray were to be painted on the doghouse, that would absorb mo re heat than white would.

1027	1	3	You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
1488	1	0	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
3936	2	3	Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table.
20565	8	2	Paul is overwhelmed that Mr. Leonard has set and broken records at college. He was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades.

3506	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
17216	7	0	One trait of Rose is that she is obediant. She retains her feelings while talking with her Aunt Kolab in the kitchen, even though she really dislikes the fact that she has to work to put her older brother through college. Rose doesn't tell her Aunt her real feelings so that it does not bother her Aunt, and so that her Aunt would not tell her mother who would be very uneased about the sitituation.
24307	9	0	He puts each peice that goes togather in the same paragraph and is good about it by not leaving antything out.
5317	3	1	China's Pandas and Australian Koalas are similar it that they are both specialists, the pandas and Koala eat almost nothing but bamboo, arole eucalyptus, respectively, unlike pythons, which are generalists. Pythons can adapt to a wide variety of habitats and fond sounds.
6526	3	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialist and need specific things to live. Pythons however don't need special things to live.
569	1	1	"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
15304	6	0	They would have a moving processes.
6778	3	0	Pandas from China are similar to koalas in Australia because neither one of these species is a carnivore, and will eat bamboo and plants. The pand in China and the koala in Australia differ from pythons will eat anything, for example one swallowed an aligator in the article.
26714	10	1	black ::  black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm.
23499	9	1	The author organizes the article by first telling you want space junk is then giving examples to reasons we have space junk. Then telling us about how the little pieces are a big deal just as the big pieces are too.
5391	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are considered a specialist species, meaning they are only found in one area and eat rarely anything else but one thing. They are different from the python because it is a generalist species, one that can be found in a variety of places and eats many different things.
8688	4	1	The word invasive means that it is dangerous to that region. The the article the animals that were called invasive were animals that were harming the envirment and were eating  important endangered species, for example in the article the snakes were eating an endangered rat in the everglades.
164	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate.
3007	2	3	The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.

1248	1	3	They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
24458	9	2	The author organizes the article in a way that is almost like a timeline. He or she first starts out by saying that you see something fall from space that is unusual to see. He or she then tells you what space junk is. Then the author tells you why this is a problem by saying that space junk can crash into other space junk and space ships. He or she finally tells you that people care about what is happening in space and that they would like to do something about it in the future.

21601	8	2	In the story I obtained information about Mr. Leonard. Telling us that he can't read, such as Paul can't read. By that occuring to him that hurt Mr. Leonard's life becuase he flunked out of college and it ruined his life. Mr. Leonard is helping Paul so that history won't repeat itself and so Paul won't end up like him.

In the article it says, ""China panda eat almost nothing but bamboo and koalas bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They both are different from pythons because pythons eat about anything an example in the article it says pythons ate a alligator."
812	1	1	I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
17167	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be hard-working. She works hard in school, goes to work, and then helps around the house every day. Even her aunt understood how she might be 'weighed down' by the things she does.
6057	3	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both eat one type of food. They are harmless animals. They are different from pythons because the are eat reptiles and they don't eat many different foods and they are also not reared like the pythons.
9195	4	2	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is that the pythons and other reptiles that are being imported are slowly taking over the areas that they are inhabiting. They are killing off native species and are invading the habitats."
6541	3	2	Pandas and koalas are both specialist animals, they eat, respectively, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves, almost exclusively. They are unlike pythons, which will eat a more general selection of prey from wood rats to alligators.
16979	7	2	In the story Rose is a very giving person. She tries to help pay for her brothers college and do an essay to receive a prize. She works all the time just to help her brother. That is why she is a very giving person.
17709	7	0	That they are like each other.  They talk like each other.
17742	7	2	One trait about Rose that is gotten from this story is that she cares about her family and loves them. During her conversation with Anna she is constantly trying to make Anna understand what's going on so Anna isn't so angry at everyone in the family. During her conversation with her aunt she is able to explain everything to her aunt, and because her aunt understands she givers her ideas for better jobs that wont weigh so much on Rose. Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is.
24737	9	2	The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article. They begin with an attention-getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader's attention, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky!', then move into describing the topic of their article, space junk, more clearly, 'The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk...' The following paragraphs explain how space junk comes to be, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other', and the article closes with the dangers of space junk, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.'
514	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
18735	7	2	Rose is dedicated to her family.  This is proven by her conversation with Anna when she says that she and her father have to work for Paul to go through school.  Also, Rose's dream reflects that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning.  All of this evidence supports the idea that Rose is dedicated to helping out her family even though sometimes it can be difficult.

23482	9	2	The author presents the subject with a few startling statements to get the reader interested with the topic.The author then goes into what his statement about space junk means, then how space junk is created, how space junk negatively effects the outer space world/environment, and how it is increasing to become a bigger problem because of the constant research with other satellites.
275	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
14025	6	1	The outer membrane of the cell controls how much goes in and out of the cell.  Through the process of osmosis, water moves in or out of a cell depending on if there is a higher or lower concentration within the cell.  Another way they control this is by the growing of the outer membrane.  If there is too much of a substance within the cell, it will break apart to allow enough room.
9510	4	0	Invasive meaning not normal or dangrous. I say this because they use words like not a normal pet to have in a home, and they use invasive for a python.
26029	10	2	black :: Black would be a good color for the doghouse because black absorbs more heat. Black absorbs more heat because it is made of no color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs all the light. In the experiment, the black held an average of 53(DEG) C after being under the lamp for ten minutes. The white lid had an average inside temperature of 42(DEG)C after beign under the lamp for ten minutes. This is a difference of 11(DEG)C and is because white is made up of all the colors so it reflects all colors of light whereas the black relfects no light.

The codons are then translated into a certain amino acid and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and then slide to the next codon. This happens multiple times until there is a long chain of amino acids that make a protein.
24251	9	2	The author organizes the article by dividing it into short sections that build upon each other.

I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.

Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.
20692	8	2	When Paul recieves the informaton on Mr. Leonard, he feels as if he is in the same boat as him. Paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before. In the story, Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes. But after he finds out that he can't read, he wants to start training Mr. Leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for Paul during the track season.

Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
21317	8	2	Paul learned about Mr. Leonard from the website that the track coach had written down for him. The website gave Paul some background information on Mr. Leonard and this helped Paul relate to Mr. Leonard's situation as a fellow student who could not read. The information also made Paul feel more emotionally attached to his trainer, as in paragraph 45, where he knew the feelings of embarrassment. The background information had an emotional effect on Paul that helped him relate to Mr. Leonard.

Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because pythons are canivores. I know this because in the article it says ''Even more dramatic was what happened in the Everglades in 2005 a python swallowed an alligator.'' That tells me that pythons are canivores and pandas and koala bears eat plants.

24496	9	2	The organization of the article begins with an introduction that catches the attention of the reader.  These opening statements are commonly said before a spectacle in the sky that are rarely seen but always beautiful.     The author continues with background information.  The next paragraphs gives a definition of space junk.  We also get a briefing on the space race and satellites in outer space.  The author shows the importance of these things when he refers to communication satellites.  By making this reference, readers feel more personal to the subject because our generation are so absorbed by communication devices.     The next paragraphs describe the effect of the crashes of space junk.  It describes the debris left in space by satellites and space shuttles.  The next section shows the importance of speed in the crashes.  Just a little bit of speed is able to cause lethal damage to space shuttles.     In closing, the author tells about the efforts of space agencies that are trying to reduce the problem.  Though space junk is increasing, the author is hopeful for a solution.

I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
23526	9	2	The author organizes the article starting with an introduction that catches the reader's attention.  The rhetorical questions are the talk about space junk will hold the reader's attention and ensure they stick around for more.  They then move into an intoduction to the space race and what space junk is.  This gives a good understanding for the reader as they continue down the article.  After that, they start with statistics that shock the reader.  That really excites the reader to reading the last paragraph.  The last few paragraphs show the impact the space junk causes, the efforts of NASA, and the fact that space junk is increasing.  This gives a nice conclusion to the paragraph.

Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.

15119	6	3	Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.

10992	5	3	When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.

Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard felt when he had to read or didn't know answers. Paul now understood that he could overcome his problems to and become a hurdler like Mr. Leonard.
23702	9	1	The author organizies his work by the smallest problem to the biggest problem. For example in 'Orbiting Junk', It is explaining the facts about space junk. In, 'What Is Space Junk?', it's telling you about space junk. In, 'Crash Course', It is explaining about the colliding of the two satelites with each other. Then in the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' It is showing how that is a serious problem to the other satellites in the air.

27376	10	2	white :: The doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42(DEG) while the average temperatures of the black , dark gray, and light gray doghouses were 53(DEG), 48(DEG), and 45(DEG) respectively.
27190	10	1	white ::  It should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color.
271	1	2	The addition information that I would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data. What is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the sume kind of container. I would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample.
1620	1	3	Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.

6599	3	1	China's pandas are similar to Australia's koala because both of these animals eat plants. In the article it states that the panda bear eats almost nothing but bamboo & the koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves most exclusively. This clearly states the difference between these animals & the python because pythons are carnivors they eat meat. In the story it says animals such as rats are becoming extinct because of the python it even tried to eat a crocodile. The 2 different kind of bears can rely on plants instead of meat.
26226	10	2	black ::  By painting the doghouse black, the air insid e the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color. In the experiment, the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53(DEG) , which is 2(DEG) higher than the dark grey lid, 8(DEG) higher than the light grey lid, and 11(DEG) higher than the white lids air temperature. This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it.

23077	9	2	This author organizes this article by first giving an introduction that popped and grabbed the reader's attention. Then, goes into more serious matter dating back to when satelites were first built. After the author explains that the satelites can crash and once they do that and 'die', they are automatically assumed as space junk. Then the author explains that even though the satelites and their peices can be little, once more and more start 'dying', then outer space can become clutered quickly.

5973	3	0	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar in the sense that they are both specialist species which live in a very specific enviornment. On the other hand, a python is a generalist and can move between climates.
9488	4	1	I think the word invasive means species from other places brought to a place were is not their type of habitat. Because in the article it stated that invasive is passing judgement.
699	1	1	In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.

24383	9	2	The author organizes this article in a very comprehensive way. The author incorporated alot of information into a very well written article. In the beginning, he has a very good introduction that actually draws a reader into the story. Next, the author really explains to the reader what space junk is. The author then explains how satellites can crash together producing smaller space junk, and the author then concludes by stating why this information matters. If these seperate sections were out of order, the story would not flow close to as well as it does.
2861	2	2	The conclusion can be made that the plastic type B has the greatest stretchability because in both trials, is stretched the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other 3 plastic types. the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary. For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable.

3024	2	0	The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
26747	10	1	white :: i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
5045	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are specialists, meaning they require one certain food and environment to survive. Pythons are generalists, who aren't very specific in what they eat. This means that they can adapt very easily to new environments, whereas, specialists cannot.
3014	2	2	In conclusion, the students data table is base on that plastic type B in both trail had most streched. The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control.
8275	4	0	The significance of the word ''invasive'' means 'rare'. For example biologists see the trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising number of invasive species, such as the Burmese python, which is breeding up storm in the Everglades and the Nile monitor lizard, a toothly creature that can reach seven feet in length and has found a happy home along the canal of Cape coral.

4980	3	2	China's panda are similar to Australias Koalas because they both have a strict diet and are picky paters. They are both different from pythons because a python will eat a lot more different food. Like the time when a python swallowed a n alligator and exploded in the Everglades in 2005.
27404	10	2	dark gray :: The color, dark gray, would affect the doghou se because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature. This way, the dogh ouse would be around 48(DEG). The doghouse would not be too hot (53(DEG) ), as it would be with the color black, but the doghouse would not be too cold (42(DEG)), as it would be with the color white.
