1673	1	1	The procedures I think they should have included inorder for me to replicate the experiment would be how different samples did they used for each? What tool did they use to determine the mass.
1674	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar they used, how much distilled water to rinse the samples with and how they obtained the mass of each sample.
1675	1	3	In order to replicate their experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into each of the containers as well as what kind of samples we are going to measure. It should state specifically marble, limestone, wood and plastic. It should also tell us on what the rocks samples will sit on as different materials may compromise the results. The last thing that would be needed to replicate this experiment is to tell us what kind of containers the samples should be put in such as wooden boxes,glass test tubes,ziploc bags etc.
1676	1	0	Pleace a simple of one material into one container and label it. Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container.
1677	1	0	Determin the mass of four different samples marble, limestone, wood, plastic. They all have starting mass and end mass, and the diffrence. The wood has the most mass but marble has the most diffrence in mass.
1678	1	2	In order to repeat the experiment you would need to know what you are testing for. They never say the reason for the experiment you need to know how much vinegar they used, because that should be the same for each container. Also in their procedure they dont tell what the samples aren't. If you only had the procedure and not the graph, you wouldnt be able to replicate is because you dont know what they were testing in the vinegar.
1679	1	0	To replicate this experiment you would need four new samples. You would also need more vinegar and new containers to do the experiment in.
1680	1	1	"After reading the procedure, there is a lot more information that they need in order to replicate this experiment. They should say how much vinegar to put into the container and which container to put it in. They should be more specific when stating how things should be measured by saying 'measure mass on a tripple-beam balance"" etc."
1681	1	3	After reading the group's procedures, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar in each container. This important because  it could affect  how much of the sample is dissolved. I would also need to know were to store the containers in a cold or hot room with light or dark. Also I would need to know the formula for finding the difference incase I didn't know. It is a common error to subtract the wrong masses. Finally, I would need to know how long to rinse each sample and whether to dry the samples under light or not.This would affect its weight.
1682	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the names of the three samples being tested in the experiment. The amount of the sample being poured into the containers would also be necessary as well as the amount of distilled water being used to rinse each sample. Another important factor would be to know the location of samples were placed in to sit and dry for 30 minutes. How the students recorded the mass would also be needed to replicate the experiment.
1683	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to determine the mass and then label each of the four containers. I would also need to put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last additional changes I would do is to clean up, gather my materials first, and then determine which material is right for solving my problem.
1684	1	1	What the hypothesis is/what they are trying to prove. How much vinegar is needed and added to each sample. What can be used as a constant?
1685	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I conclude, that they need for me to replicate the experiment is, where do you put the samples when you replace them from the containers and how to determine the mass.
1686	1	3	To replicate the group's experiment, the procedure would have to state how much vinegar was poured into the containers. Also, they should specify what kinds of containers they were using as this could affect the results. In the procedure, they also failed to tell what 4 samples were used in the experiment, a key variable to it's success.
1687	1	1	Some information that I would need to replicate the experiment are a list of the materials Id need to know how to determine the mass, because those things are not stated in the procedure.
1688	1	2	To replicate this experiment the person would need to state how much vinegar to use, how they re going to determine the mass of the end and how long to rinse of the samples with water.
1689	1	3	Information that would be required to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar to be poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample of material, and where to store the sample when they are drying from the vinegar.
1690	1	0	The student should have stated in the hypothesis that they predicted and correct or not. Also they should have added what could've went wrong in the experiment and what should they have worked on to make better.
1691	1	2	In the procedure, there is not enough information for someone to replicate this experiment. The procedure should include namingine four samples that need to be determined and how much vinegar needs to be poured in the containers. The students should also state what they will be measuring when determining the mass. These three things could improve the procedure of the experiment.
1692	1	2	One piece of information that I would add is how much vinigar to use in each container. The 2nd piece I would add is how big the container should be. A third piece of information that I would add to this experiment is to tell the person to mark all the information down into a nice organized table.
1693	1	0	For me to be able to replicate this experiment, i would just have to follow the procedure over again.For example, i would have to determine the mass of all four samples. Next i would pour the vinegar in each of four separate containers and act.
1694	1	0	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is you would need to know the data collected from before. Another thing you would need is to know the collected information, on last and final thing you would need to know is what happened after the next before having it out for 30 mins. What was in the when you pilled it out.
1695	1	0	In this experiment I would also include how it looked after 24 hours why the mass went down and why you would put the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1696	1	1	You would need a list of things to get supplies. Those would include such things as a scale, cups the samples, vinegar and distilled water. Another thing needed was the names of the samples themselves in the question. And there is no reason or problem stated.
1697	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the samples you're using are. In step 1, it says to determine the mass of  four different samples. Also, in step 3 it tells you to place each sample in a different container. However,you are never told what the samples are that you are using.
1698	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. I would need to know this because if I just poured vinegar into four cups, the amounts would be different and it could change the results of my expierement.
1699	1	1	Any additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to use so there are same amount in each container, how much water to rinse 4 with because to little might not wash off all the vinegar and to much might wash off some of the materials and affect the final mass, also students may need to know what unit to measure the materials in. So they can get almost exactly what the other group got.
1700	1	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to find out what kind of containers I need. I would also need to know what to put the samples on to sit and dry. Finally I would need to find out what the students used to obtain the mass of the samples.
1701	1	3	The procedure is very unclear. In order to replicate this experiment, the procedure must be more specific, for example, instructions must be made about; how much vinegar must you pour into the containers, what kind of containers should be used, specify what the four samples are in the procedure.
1702	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to add to the procedure. First, you'd need to know what four samples to use, how much of the sample to use, how much vinegar to add to the sample, decide what container to put the sample in and how much distilled water is used to rinse the sample.
1703	1	2	To be able to separate this experiment, their needs to be  more information in the procedure. The students should be specified for amount of vinegar added to the samples. The students should've added that the experiment should be repeated to be sure the results were correct. The last thing that was  missing from  the procedure is a list of the four samples being used.
1704	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment they must supply more specific information for example,they should list the four different sample names. Second they should give the size of the container. Last, they must specify how much vinegar and the possible strength of that vinegar.
1705	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, information that needs to be included is, tell what they are taking samples of. Another thing they should include to how much vinegar they are mixing with each sample. The final thing they should include is about how much of each sample to use. Those would be needed to replicate the experiment.
1706	1	2	Well, the procedure does not state what the four samples are and you need to know that in order to do anything. You also need to know how much vinegar should be used. And you would need to know whether the samples are placed into the same containers as the ones with vinegar.
1707	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar you need to put into each container. You need to have a control sample. After washing the sample, do you put it back into the container?
1708	1	2	Give the amount of each sample needed for the experiment have the amount of vinegar needed to the experiment. Give the amount of freely to rinse and how long do  varies  and should the all same time and what temperature was the water.
1709	1	2	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the control was. If there even was one to begin with. The measurements for the vinegar and amount of each material placed in the vinegar are also left out. The names of the materials should also be mentioned in the procedure.
1710	1	2	After reading the group's procedure the additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be the different samples used. How much vinegar is going to be poured into each of the containers and what should the containers be labled.
1711	1	1	In order for me to replicate the experiment, I would need o know how much, vinegar to pour in each cup, and how much f one substance. Without doing that it can effect each substance differently.
1712	1	2	The procedureshould explain what the samples are. The procedure should say to calculate the difference in mass of each substance. The procedure should explain how much vinegar to use.
1713	1	1	Some additional informatio would of bee what four examples should we whaz or what adding vinegar to the samples as getting to do.
1714	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know what materials the samples are made of. Step number three would need to be revised to say that each sample has it's own cup of vinegar. Also an amount of vinegar was not determined. A constant starting mass should have been used between the four materials because the vinegar may have ecoded more of one material due to a larger amount of surface area.
1715	1	2	Some additional information that you would need to replicate this experiment would be things like the mass of each of the samples before they were put in the vinegar. The temperature of the vinegar when it was put in the cup with the samples, the size of the containers that the sample and solution were in and the amount of vinegar that they put in the cups, and also weather they did multiple trails or not.
1716	1	0	You would need the nishpoping  and you would need to know were they got the number from.
1717	1	1	How much vinegar do you put into the containers. Take out materials. Determine the mass with a triple beam balance.
1718	1	1	To replicate this experiment I need to know the materials and how to find the mass because one cannot assume that another person knows what they are doing.
1719	1	0	At least include three piece of information in order to replicate the experiment. The procedure are determine the mass of four defferent samples. Pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers, place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a single sample into a single container after 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. Determine the mass of each sample.
1720	1	1	In the procedure it should state how to determine the mass of each material. Also it should state the amount of vinegar poured into the container.
1721	1	2	Three pieces of information needed to replicate the experiment are: (1) Amount of vinegar poured into the containers. (2) Size of samples (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) and (3) How much distilled water is used to rinse the samples.
1722	1	1	To replicate this experiment, it would be important to know how much vinegar should be poured into the four containers in step 2. This is unclear, therefore the amount of vinegar should be specified. Next, the group should specify how much a single sample is. The samples should be constant, therefore results are comparable. The group should decide on a certain mass sample to use for the four materials. Lastly to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. Right now this information is vague.
1723	1	3	"In order to replicate this experiment, I believe that the group needs to include more information on the sample. They need to say where the samples are being stored during the 24 hours and at what temperature. Based on this given information, the could be located outdoors or indoors where the temp would effect the rock sample. Also, they must include the amount of vinegar used in the container. They simply tell us to ""pour vinegar"" but never include an amount."
1724	1	1	To determine the mass put what form of weight system your weighing it on grams pounds etc...When  pouring the vinegar put what you'll be measuring Witer ,ml, liters etc be none describtive  when labeling samples.
1725	1	1	You would need to know how much vinigar to put in. You would need to know what the group is testing. You would also need to know what the group is testing for, what is their statement ?
1726	1	1	Some additional information that i would need is I was to replicate this experiment is what samples to get. They would need to say we got all four samples then heated them. Another piece of information that I may need is to find out the difference in mass from befor and after the experiment. And last is to have a step that says to release the scale so that the mass can be removed.
1727	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment the procedure would need to include the amount of vinegar used in each cup. We would also need to know what the samples are while the data table identifies them, it is not clear from the procedure what  we are testing. Also, we would need to know exactly what it is were testing. The procedure should include something about recording the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass.
1728	1	1	In order to replicate the expiment, you must have to mention the four types of samples. List the mass and after you have, you see the difference in mass and double with the information of the results of the mass.
1729	1	1	The Additional information i would need in other to replicate the experiment is to named the sample that i would have used in the expeement.
1730	1	1	I would add how much vinegar is being added to the four containers. I would also add more samples to the lab. And I would repeat the lab again to see if I get the same answers.
1731	1	3	The first thing I would have to know is. What are my samples going to be of? I would also want to know how much vinegar I'm suppose to pour in each container. I also would need to know what type of container I'm to store the samples in.
1732	1	3	1. Determine the mass of four different samples; marble, limestone, wood and plastic ^p 2. Pour 20ml of vinegar in each of four seperate, but identical beakers. ^p 3. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container place all of containers in the same place.
1733	1	0	You would also need beakers and test tube and a timer.
1734	1	3	You would need to know how much vinegar needed for each container, also how big the containers are that you need to put the materials in to ensure that they fit. The placement of the containers is important because if they are left in the sun when they shouldn't be, it could change the results. How much distilled water one needs to put into each container is important to know too.
1735	1	0	Besides knowing the procedure, in order to replicate this experiment I would have to know what the problem is that we are trying to solve. That way, I could make sure I am coming up with the right information to answer the problem. Another piece of information I would have to know is if there is a control group. This is because if there was one, I could compare my data from the different samples to the control group. Also I would have to know what the control variables are because if all of the variables that need to be controlled are not that my information would not be as valid as it could be.
1736	1	3	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to add in each container and how big each containers. It also doesn't let you know how big each sample should be or what type of material. Plus it should remind people to wear goggles and clean up their area.
1737	1	3	The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar that was pored into each container, the temperature of vineger, how long and visarable the samples should be rinsed, number of trials, type of container the sample should be placed in, and what types of equipment should be used to determine the mass.
1738	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in the four containers.
1739	1	0	You wouldn't need any additional information. That prscjar was correct and could be duplicated the way it is presented in the procedure.
1740	1	3	What kind of vinegar,how much vinegar,what kind of surrounding do you dry the samples.
1741	1	2	After reading this group procedure i would need to know how many units of vinegar should be added to each cup, which samples to test, not what the starting mass for each sample should be these three factors were left out and these factors are vital to the experiment.
1742	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment the students should add more procedures. They would double the hours to see what would happen. Repeat the experiment and not rinse the samples with distilled water. And don't dry the samples.
1743	1	2	To replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar was used for the samples to sit in. We would also need to know what the samples were that we were testing in order for the experiment to work. And we would also need to know that we should be recording all of the data that we were collecting. We would also need to know that we should subtract the differences in masses to be able to compare the results.
1744	1	0	The additional information you will need is at the end say to record what you have found out. Also I would say has with distilled water to use to use plan's ruin anything.
1745	1	2	1. The amount of metrials that you need.^p 2.How much vinegar do you pour.
1746	1	1	The additional information needed would be if there was a constant variable. If there was a certain temperature that the samples sat in and how they got the difference in mass.
1747	1	1	I think that I would need the timing because I guess they have to take the time and I also think that I need the measure of the four mass samples. And how big were the materials.
1748	1	2	I would need to know what four different samples to use, what kind of containers to put them in and I would also need to know how to find the mass of each of the samples after they dried. Without this information, I could not replicate this lab.
1749	1	3	The procedure needs to state what samples to use instead of asking the reader refer to the data. For exact data. The procedure must also state how much vinegar to use. Also, step three doesn't state whether or not to put the samples in the water but separate containers as the vinegar.
1750	1	0	Need to know how much weight of the sample to start with, how much acid rain should be put in the test tubes.
1751	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. This would allow the experiment to work adiguity. If one container had more vinagar than the other then the experiment would fail.
1752	1	2	When the procedure says pour vinegar in each container you don't know how much vinegar to put in.Also when it says place a sample of one material, I don't know how much that is to put in the container. It also doesn't say how big the container has to be.
1753	1	0	The I.V.,D.V.,control variables, and constant variables must be included in the procedure.
1754	1	2	In order to make this experiment replicable you would need to be more specific. For step number three it should clarify which sample and how much of it to place in the container. They should add a step between three and four saying where to place. He samples for 24 hours for the last step they should explain how to determine the mass by using a triple beam balance.
1755	1	3	One thing that would be helpful to be able to replicate this experiment would be to know how much vinegar to pour in the containers and how big the containers are. They should have also told us what the materials were that they were using, and how much of it to use. Another thing that should have been included was how they are going to determine the mass of everything.
1756	1	3	1.You would need to know the four types of samples in this experiment. ^p 2.You need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four containers. ^p 3.You need to know what temperatures to have the samples in, (room warm, cold).
1757	1	3	To replicate the experimenty, you would need to know the amount of vinegar placed in each container. You would also need to know the temperature at which the containers were stored. In addition you would need to know what materials the samples were.
1758	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment the additional information I would need to know is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. I would need to know how long I should rinse the samples with distilled water. I would also need to know how this group determined the mass of each sampe in order to replicate the experiment.
1759	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to knowhow much vinegar was used, to see if that played a major factor on the difference in mass. Also you need to know how much distilled water is used to rinse off each sample, because the water may wear away the sample. Even more lastly, youoneed to know what youre measuring the mass with.
1760	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the additional information you would need is what the samples were, how much vinegar was put into the containers and also the temperature of what they are going to put the containers, because whether vinegar may us more acidic.
1761	1	2	After reading this procedure, I have figured out that you would need to know  the type of the containers used, weather or not they wer test tubes, beakers, etc. Also, you would need to know how much of each sample you would need, in oz, kg, g, etc. Finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to use in l, ml, etc.
1762	1	0	Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the data table that was recorded starting the into on each sample. Information such as the samples starting to ending mass and difference is very important to understand because it is needed to understand the results of the experiment.
1763	1	2	First I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers second I would need to know what the, size of each sample needs to be. Then I have to know how much acidity is in the water.
1764	1	1	You would not need any other information to replicate the experiment they tell you how long to put the samples in the vinegar, how to rinse them, how big to let them sit. But one thing is how much vinegar did they use in each container.
1765	1	1	The additional information that I would add is how much vinegar in each container I would also add a purpose of the experiment. After massing the samples on step 6, determine the sample difference in before and after weight.
1766	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, some information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to measure out how much liquid vinegar they used for each sample, and then measure it again after they take the centiment are to measure it.
1767	1	2	Well after reading the groups procedure, I relized that the additional information they need to give you is how much vinegar to pour into the four separate but identical, containers. The group does not show that the samples sat for 24 hours then they removed the samples and rinsed each sample with distilled water.Also how do I know like where I am supposed to dry them in a windowsill in the cup, in a microwave, or just to let it sit there till it drys.
1768	1	0	The three most important pieces of info that would need to replicate this experiment is to determine the mass of the diifferent samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers, and after 24 hours resume the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
1769	1	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar was used, What sae was the container that held the vinegar, and what temperature the containers where kept at durring the 24hrs.
1770	1	3	Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are, what are the 4 different samples that I would be testing, what size container would I need and how much vinegar do I use.
1771	1	2	"In step one, the procedure needs to explain what four materials are being tested. It is not specific enough by just saying ""four different sample"". In step 2, the procedure should state how much vinegar needs to be added to each container. The reader has no way of knowing this information. ^p The procedure says that the containers should each be labeled, but it does not explain how they should be labeled, or what they should say. In order to be able to replicate this experiment, that must be clarified."
1772	1	3	Some of the things that you would need inables to repeat this experiment is, tell you what samples they are using. All they say is, get the mass of four different samples, don't state what they are. Also how much vinegar is being added to the containers. They did not say what amount of vinegar they put in. The last thing is that,
1773	1	3	"To replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the ""samples"" mentioned in step 1 are. This way, there would be no confusion as to what materials you are working with. Also, you would need to know what kind of containers the ""samples"" are kept in. Lastly, in order to properly replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container."
1774	1	0	I would need to know how the samples look in the procedure. I feel like this because i already knoxw starting, ending and difference in all mass. To do the difference, i would have to kneew how it was doing threw the procedures.
1775	1	2	After reading this groups procedure, I decided that it would need more information in order for me to accurately replicate in one thing. I thought it would need be a given amount of vinegar to be put in each cue, like 63 ml for example. I also thought that the names of the samples (marble, limestone, wood and plastic ) should be given, for without them, I would not know I was testing. Lastly, I would include a final step thus told the sender to determine the difference between the starting and inding mass, so that the reader knows where to go next.
1776	1	2	One would need to know how much vinegar went into each container. One would also need to know how the samples were and their masses.
1777	1	1	First the group should tell how much of the vinegar to use Also they should say how much vinegars the experiment needs to be done. Finally they should tell you what in the materials being weighted on.
1778	1	3	There are three pieces of information you might need to replicate this experiment. The first is how much vinegar to use in each container. A second would be the type of conditions the container was placed in over night because things like light might cause a faster or more effective reaction on the samples. Third, you would need to know in what form the samples are. The marble or limestone could be in small rock form as oppose to all solid blocks which may cause the reaction to have a different outcome.
1779	1	1	This group should for scientific verification, repeat I the experiment at least twice. They should also specify the amount of vinegar in each container. The group should have had a control to contrast their findings.
1780	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar you would put in each container. And also, you'd have to make sure that you put equal amounts into each container, or else you would find an number of errors in the experiment.
1781	1	2	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Also, I would need to know how much distilled water I would need to rinse each sample, and for how long.
1782	1	0	Determine the mass of four different samples. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single container. Determine the mass of each sample. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
1783	1	2	In order to repeat this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each of the four samples. This would be essential for us to repeat the experiment step by step. It would also be helpful to determine how much of each sample to put in each container. And finally, in order to repeat this experiment, we would also have to do another trial and probably include a control variable to repeat this experiment exactly like the group of students.
1784	1	3	To replicate the experiment by just reading the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured onto the samples and affects the mass, also what type & size the container was because that would affect the concentration of the vinegar and also what material the sample were at the type of environment (temperature, brightness) they were left in for the 24 hour period because that would also affect the end result.
1785	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, additional information should be added. For example, the procedure should explain what type of samples to use, include the number of tools that are needed and how much of an object or sample you need. After adding these procedures, a person would be able to repeat this experiment.
1786	1	1	Some information needed to replicate this procedure would be the temperature that this experiment. Another piece of information would be a graph. And lastly would be a better explanation.
1787	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in each of four separate containers. Did you remove the samples from the containers and rinse the samples with distilled water? Also how long did you let the samples sit and dry?
1788	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment, what will be needed is the depended, independent and the control, which are vinegar, the container and the timing to each sample.
1789	1	3	To replicate this procedure, information such as how much vinegar to pour into the containers as instructed in step 2 , what materials were used in step 3, or how much of the material was used, also in 3 would be crucial.
1790	1	1	-What temperature (environment) should the containers be placed it. Cold? Hot? Room temp? ^p -After 24 hours do you need gloves and or goggles to work with this samples ? ^p -Where could 2 find marbles and limestone?
1791	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment I need to know specifically what samples they are talking about, what type of control to use in this  experiment and how much vinegar to pour in each container. I would also be useful to know if when storing the sample for 24 hours, if they should be in a certain temperature (room temp,high temp, or low temp. etc).
1792	1	2	The students should have included. how they determined the mass of the four samples in steps 1 or 6.They also needed to include how much vinegar they poured in the containers as well as how much water they used to rinse the samples, or how long they rinsed them.
1793	1	0	A group os student idid a science project called acid pain had to determine four different samples. The put the four different samples which is marble, limestone, wood and plastic in four different cups filler with vinegar and afther 24 hours rinse the examples and dry them for 30 minutes and see what is the mass afther every sample loss mass expect for wood. I had the same mass afther it was measured.
1794	1	1	I think the group should mention how much vinegar they are using for measurements. And they should include to record data procedure should be writen more clearly it would be hard to do this lab looking at this procedure they gave us.
1795	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, one would need much more information. Firstly, step 2 says to pour vinegar into four containers. In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each. I would also need to know how much of the four different samples (marble, limestone, wood and plastic) to use. Also, in step 5 it says to let the samples sit and dry for 30 mins. I would need to know if I should let them dry at room temp, in a cold location, in a sunny spot etc.
1796	1	1	After reading the groups procedure some peices of information you would need to replicate the expieriment is the samples like marble, limestone and wood.
1797	1	0	I think you will need a bottle of vinegar,a container cabels, temer, paper, a manole, a cemenstone, wood and a plastic. You will  need..
1798	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know how much vinger to pour into the samples. You  will also need to know  what are the four samples. You will also need to know constents & controls. The procedure needs to be made clear.
1799	1	1	You would need to know the containers size, and what you measure the samples with
1800	1	0	Step one:pour a vinegar in four identical containers. ^p Step two:Place a meterial in each container and label it. ^p Step three:After 24 hours remove the material and rinse it out with water. ^p Step four:Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes and determine the mass.
1801	1	1	In the procedure they did not tell the sample's that they was doing to be testing. Also didn't tell us what mass was when they started and when they was finish what was the mass. Last they didn't tell us that they need to find the difference in mass.
1802	1	1	"In order to correct the errors in this experiment, some few things need to be changed. Firstly, the procedure never mentions recording your data; this needs to be part of the procedure. Secondly, the procedure states, ""determine the mass."" It is not explained how to do so and what to use. Thirdly, the procedure never tells what samples are or what to label them as in the experiment. This is extremely important because the people doing the experiment need to know what they are working with."
1803	1	2	Their are three things that i would need to know to repeat the procedure. The first thing is in their procedure they do not mention the four samples. Another thing is the procedure does not state the pH of the vinegar. Also they do not repeat the process for greater validity. Another thing is it serves ways to setup the content in the procedure.
1804	1	3	"In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know, first, what were the samples when they just said ""sample"" If I don't know thetype of thesample then how was I supposed to test for  anything, I also would need to know what type of containers they were talleg about wer they using for small graduated cylinder or were or were they using a 50 gallon unit. Finally, I would need to know they amounts, I  need the amounts of the samples, the vinegar, and the distilled water."
1805	1	1	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is what materials I would need for this experiment, the amount I'm support to pour in the containers and what are the samples.
1806	1	1	How much vinegar they are pouring in to each sample.
1807	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment I would need the following information. First I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. Second, I would need to find out the exact size of of four identical containers. Finally I would need to know the temperature at which the four materials sat for 24 hours, because the temperatures of the solution/room could affect the results.
1808	1	2	I would need toknow: How much vinegar to put in each container, How to weigh the mass of the doyeds, how big of the object do I need.
1809	1	1	"In order to replicate this experiment, I'll need more information. If I wanted to find the change in mass of the four samples, I would've had each sample weigh the same at the begining of the experiment. Also to make this lab more correct, all of the samples should have the same amount of vinegar in them. Lastly, in order to make the lab more correct, I would put the exact steps in the procedure. Instead of saying ""repeat"", it'd be better, and easier if it said exactly what to do."
1810	1	0	In order to repeat his group's procedure you must have the same amour of mass of each cup. Place the same material into the same one it had (the mass amount). Then procead with the same thing that you did with the last one. Sit for 24 hours then rince with distiled water.
1811	1	1	To replicate the expeirment, you would need to know the purpose. Knowing the purpose of the expeirment allows the person to know what to look for or to expect. You would also need to know what type of containers to do the expeirment in so the experiment doesn't go wrong. You would need to know where to remove the samples into after taken out of their containers. You would also need to know what to do with the containers afterwards.
1812	1	0	In order to replicate this experiment, you need to explain why the samples loss mass, what cause it to loss its host or why did it stay the same. Yo also need to tell us what you saw,show us what happened when the samples were lossing its mass. Maybe you need to try chemicals on the samples beside vinegar.
1813	1	3	The group would need to state how much vinegar was in each container. They would need to state how long to rinse each container with distilled water. They would need to identify what the four samples are in the procedure, and to say to record the data.
1814	1	3	you would need to know how much venegar to put in. A;so the strength of vinegar( if  there is a difference) .Where should the container so far the of have i.e in a every regardless, room temperature
1815	1	0	You would need: ^p 1)Conclusion about how you did everything. ^p 2)Results of how everything came out as you wanted. ^p 3)Information about the procedures.
1816	1	0	I think that you should start each sample with the same amount of mass, so that your result will be more accurate. Also instead of writing the differences they should have recorded the final results to make it less confusing.
1817	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how to determine the mass. Just stating 'determine the mass' does not tell me how to. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to the containers to make the data accurate and constant. I would need to know where to dry the samples would they need to be in the sun, shade, etc.
1818	1	2	In order to replicate the expirement we would need amount of vinegar used, size of container used and how much distilled water was used for rinsing.
1819	1	1	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be a more specific description of mass, and how much mass you are using what kind of containers need to be used and what size.
1820	1	0	They should have done more tests. They also should have wrote what the experament was about.
1821	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into each container. You would also need  to know the amount of distilled water the container are to be rinsed with and what qualities  a sample to be the most efficient.
1822	1	2	I would need to know what sample was put in each container. Also how much vinegar was poured into each container.
1823	1	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, as well as the size and shape of each container. You would also want to know the type of vinegar used, all three of the factors are important to insure consistency and increase validity.
1824	1	1	To be able to replicate this problem you would have to know how much vinegar is going into each container. Also why they are performing the experiment what the problem is what are the different samples.
1825	1	1	There are several pieces of information missing from this procedure.  First, it is important to know in the procedure that the samples are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. This information is not given until the data table, also, the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. Finnally, it is necessary to know how much of each sample material should be added to the containers with vinegar. With this information, replicating the experiment would be much easier.
1826	1	0	The additional information is how are we suppose  to measure the mass of the object, they need a indenpent varible and I  need to then the control.
1827	1	3	The additional information needed is: ^p -Name the specific samples used in the procedure ^p -Say how much vinegar one needs to pour into containers ^p -Should the samples sit in light, dark areas or covered ?
1828	1	2	Some information that  you would  need is the amount of vinegar you should pour into theseperate containers. Second of all we should also know how long we rinse the samples for. Finally, we need the previous results to compare data.
1829	1	2	Additional information needs to be added to this procedure they need to put gather materials for step one. They need to tell exactly what samples (rocks). They need to add the amount of vinigar they are going to pour in. They need to make the last sentence in step three a separate step. This procedure was not carefully organized.
1830	1	2	What the group forgot to do was tell the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. The group also forgot to include whether or not if they need to cover each container. They forgot to tell what metric unit to measure the materials with which was grams.
1831	1	3	In order to replicate this acid rain experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to use since it should remain a constant. Also how big each sample is, results will not be accurate if the samples are not similar in size. Also all samples should be kept at the same temperature in the same area so they are not affected differently.
1832	1	3	The group could have told how much vinegar, the acual size of the container they used and the size if all the samples. For example, how lange  was the piece of wood? Would size make a difference in the ending mass and the calculation of the difference in mass.
1833	1	0	In this table it's says that first when starting mass that time marble was 9.8 then it's decrease it would 9.4. So it's decrease -0.4. In limestone the mass is decreas too. First, starting mass is 10.4 and then ending mass is 9.1. It's difference beetween -1.3. In wood no change. In starting mass it was 11.2 and ending mass it would 11.2 too. So it's in no change. In plastic starting mass is 7.2 and ending mass is 7.1. It is decreases. It's in difference beetween -0.1. I think wood is not heavy then other that's why it's in no change. Then limestone It's in big change to other because it's heavy them other.
1834	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know what was in each of the four samples. Also one must know how much vinegar to pour into each sample. You would also have to know which sample of material was placed in which container.
1835	1	1	You would need to include what the samples are of. You would need to include where to record data. Finally, you would also need to know if the mass of each sample should be the same. Without those bits of information, it would be difficult to replicate the experiment.
1836	1	3	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need to see a few more pieces of information in their procedure. Firstly, I would need to know what types of samples to use. I can see what samples the group used by looking at their data table, but I would want to know if I had to use the same ones. Also, I would have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, because my results could change if I use a different amount of vinegar than the group did. Depending on the amount of vinegar I use, the third thing I would need to know is how big the samples should be. If it is important for the vinegar to cover the sample, the procedure should tell me that so I don't make the sample too big.
1837	1	1	To replicate the experiment, additional information would include new loco 10 wait before trying the experiment again.It should are state how much of the samples are bein put into the container and how long the samples should be rinsed for.
1838	1	1	Additional information that would need are to list what are the different samples being used
1839	1	3	In order to replicate this procedure I would need to know what the materials were,the size of the material, and how much vinegar was in each container.
1840	1	0	This isn't a clear statement. Use to this expirement the problem would explain why the students were conducting this expirement in the first place.
1841	1	1	The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be knowing what the solutions are such as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You need to be more specific so the reader can completely do the experiment by themselves without asking questions.
1842	1	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know what safety precautions I should be taking the exart amount of vinegar to pour into each container, and where the samples should be kept during the 24 hours they are in the container.
1843	1	2	The person conducting the experiment would have to know what the samples were; the procedure didn't include that knowledge. Another piece of information that would be needed to repeat the experiment would be how much vinegar is used for each sample and is the amount kept constant. The last piece of information that is needed is what safety equipment should be used; safety procedures are often included in the experiment's procedure.
1844	1	3	"There is some additional information needed to replicate the this experiment. For example, the procedure does not say how much vinegar to use. It also just says ""samples"" and doesn't specify what the samples are of. The procedure also does not tell us what type of containers to use or say to record your data."
1845	1	2	If I were to rewrite the procedure I would incude what the samples were. Also I would include how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers.
1846	1	2	In order to replicate the group's experiment, one must know the amount of vinegar used on each of the samples. Also, what type and the amount of sample is needed. In addition, knowing the purpose of the lab would be highly benefitial so that one knows what to test for. It's imperitive to add the amount of samples and the amount of vinegar inorder to perform the experiment in all exactness. Otherwise, one might receive not only different but in accurate data.
1847	1	1	The students need to be more specific. They need to state how much vinegar to pour into each of the 4 cups. Second, they never said what unit or never said when to record the data. Lastly they needed to state how much distilled water.
1848	1	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the cups. You would also need to know how long to rise the sample with distilled water.
1849	1	1	Additional information that would be needed is the initial amount of vinegar, then the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours, and then the difference in the volume. If I had those three pieces of info, I would be able to replicate the experiment and possibly compare answers.
1850	1	3	Additional information needed to replicate
1851	1	1	To follow this groups procedure I would have to be more detailed, like instead of saying samples all the way through the procedure it would have been better if they  the four things that they were testing in it would be less confusion. In step two it would have  been much better they just made it less complicated and sad place the marble, limestone, wood, and plants samples into their own seperate identical containers and label them. It would have been good to ,explain why they were told to find the mass of their samples.
1852	1	1	The information you would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the four different samples, the starting , ending and difference in mass, you would need the four samples ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic)  because that's what the experiment is on. You would need the starting  mass, ending mass and the difference in mass because that's how your doing the experiment.
1853	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would also want to test all these four samples in water as a control, in the same exact procedure. Furthermore, it is also important to retest this experiment under a constant like room temperature to make sure it is not a variable in the results. Lastly, to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the chemicals in acid rain and chemical composition of vinegar to see if they corrolate and that this experiment is a good representation of what happens wi acid rain.
1854	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know what samples were used. If I did not use the same samples my experiment could come out differently. I would also need to know what unit to weigh the mass in. If I weighed it differently we could get different results. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container that could affect the outcome of my experiment.
1855	1	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know what the ''samples'' were. Without this information, it would be impossible to do the experiment. One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in to each container- this could effect the outcome of the experiment. In addition, one would need to know the temperature of the vinegar which could also effect the outcome of the experiment.
1856	1	0	Additional information that you might need in order to replicate the experiment is to conduct a hypothesis you will need to get organized and gather all information to be able to perform a conclusion in the end with the information.
1857	1	3	1) I would need to know which type of materials to use for the samples. ^p 2) I would need to know how much vineagar to put in each containar. ^p 3) I would need to know the approximate size of the samples.
1858	1	2	One additional information needed would be how to determine the mass of each sample. How much vinegar would be put in to each of the containers. How big would the containers need to be.
1859	1	3	You would need to say what different sample you had in the experiment. Where would you put them over night. How big would the containers be for the samples.
1860	1	3	Additional data that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that was added into the container because if one sample measured more  or less than another, the data may also bear altered.I would also need to know the size or the container used and what type of units they were measured with. Lastly to be able to replicate this experiment. One would also need to know the temperature for every it's materials. Such as dabbing and wiping a papas towel or just simply allowing them to sit and dry on a substance.
1861	1	1	There is not enough information to be able to replicate the experiment. Firstly they should state the samples you need to use in step one. There should also be a control for you to compare it to. The final error is that step 4 is too vague. It says to remove the samples but not how to, for example with tongs or wearing plastic gloves.
1862	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know the size of each of the samples. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar being used. Last, I would need to know the size of the containers being used and how long to rinse the samples of rock for.
1863	1	0	Do the experiment again but with a different solution. ^p Let the samples sit for 48 hours. ^p Instead of sit and dry. Dry the sample with a paper towel or cloth.
1864	1	2	The group did not include the temperature that they left the remaining samples. They also did not include the amount of vinegar that we should pour in the four separate containers. Also they should of do the experiment more than once to make sure the answers they come out with, were alright.
1865	1	1	The group's procedure needs to be more specific. They need amounts in the procedure. They do not tell you how much vinegar is to be poured. Also what is needed to determine the mass of the samples. Also the samples, how much of the sample we need.
1866	1	1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know the control of the experiment, what amount of vinegar is poured on sample,what is being tested including independent and dependent variade.
1867	1	1	In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I need to pour into each container, if I would need to stable the mass of the samples with the vinegar still on it and also ruck at why & am even performing this experiment.
1868	1	1	The lab needs to include what samples are being added to the vinegar. Next time the lab should say that you should place a sample of marble,limestone, wood and plastic to each vinegar sample.
1869	1	1	To repeat this experiment they would need a balence to measure the mass of each building material. You would also need a graduated cylinder to measure out the vinger out. In the experiment it does say the amount of vinger used.
1870	1	3	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment woold be what types of containers, what type of materials, and lastly how much vinegar should be poured in to each container,  because it doesn't state these items in their proceduer.
1871	1	0	You would also need to.
1872	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they put in the containers. You would also have to know how to dry the samples. Then you would have to know how to dry the samples.
1873	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment , in the procedure it should say to write down or mark a chart saying the starting mass and ending mass and start the experiment. You need to write down this information because it helps to find out the mass of the different samples.
1874	1	3	In order to replicate the procedure, I would need to know what volume of vinegar to use. I would also need to know what sized containers or beaker to use. The procedure should also explain what equipment to use when removing the samples from the container such as tongs. Lastly, within the procedure, it should state what samples will be used.
1875	1	3	The procedure should look like this-1) Determine the mass of 4 different samples; marble, limestone, water and plastic. 2) Pour 10ml (how much) of vinegar in each 4 separate, but identical containers. 3) Place a sample of one material into one container & label. Repeat w/remaining samples, placing a single sample into a single contem. After 24 hours, remov the samples from the containers & rinse with distilled water for 3 minutes. 5) Allow the samples to sit & dry for 30 minutes at room temperature. 6) Determine the mass of each sample by subtracting the start mass (in grams) from ending mass in grams ).
1876	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each cup, so each sample would be sitting in the same amount of vinegar. I would need to know how long to rinse the sample: for so they are rinsed an equal amount of time. Also I need to know if each sample is supposed to way the same or be the same size.
1877	1	2	IN the procedure, it didn't  tell what the sample's were. Step 2 said to pour vinegar in four indentical containers but it didn't tell how much to pour. 1, we don't measure them, we are going to do the experiment wrong. Step 1 could of said record the starting mass of each of the four samples; marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1878	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, I believe that I would need the following information in order to replicate the experiment. I would need the different types of materials listed in the procedure.
1879	1	2	To do the experiment, you would have to know the starting masses, how much vinegar must be added to each container and what the sample materials are
1880	1	3	In order to replicate the group's procedure you would need to know ^p -How much vinegar should be pour each cup? ^p -What type of container should be used? ^p -If the container should be left in the light or dark overnight or it avoid be covered.
1881	1	0	The pour into the take the vinegar in each containers. ^p who is the problem ( Hypothesis) ^p How you can do this experiment ^p A table who explain the experiment ^p use more types of masses like glass, paper, etc.
1882	1	3	One other thing you would need to know is the amount of vinegar placed in each container, so all samples have the same amount. Another thing needed to be known is where are the containers should be placed for 24 hours, because the amount of sunlight might effect the experiment. Other than than, this experiment is replicable.
1883	1	2	Additional information is to include the sample names to label them. How much vinegar to use in the containers so the outcome is fair for all samples, and also point out which is the independent variable and when is the dependent variable and which is the dependent variable to understand the lab better.
1884	1	1	You would need to tell how much vinegar was add to each sample atthe start.
1885	1	2	The procedure needs a control for each sample material. This would be done by placing each sample into 4 more containers with no vinegar. to use. The procedure needs to say the amount of vinegar to put into each container. The procedure should also say specifically what four samples to use.
1886	1	2	The group should have provided a control so that I could compare my results in it. They also should have been more clear about exactly how much  vinegar I should put into each container. Each container should have the same amount , but they didn't state what that was. The group should have also been more specific about the size of the samples being experimented on. I'm not sure if they all are the same or different.
1887	1	2	It would be best of they specify what they are sampling in 1 in the procedure. It should say determine the mass of four different samples of material. In step number 2, it says pour in vinegar but not how much. They should lied is at something like 150 ml. For the graph it would be better if there was a column, where it listed the percentages post so that the reader can understand which material was effected the mass.
1888	1	1	After reading the groups procedure, one would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container.
1889	1	1	. Amount of vinegar would be needed. ^p . Purpose of the experiment would be needed. ^p . Hypothesis would be needed.
1890	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment we need to know how much of the vinegar to poor in each container, we would also need to know units of measurement we are  using to determine the mass, and what the samples are.
1891	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would need to get an average for the results. Lastly, you would need to have samples with the same mass at the start.
1892	1	2	Some additional information I would need to replicate this experiment are the names of the different types of material so I knew I am testing. The amount of vinegar poured into each container needed to be stated on the results will come out accurate. Another part of information  that should have been included was a control of just water for each sample so there is something to compare the other results to.
1893	1	0	We would need to have a contini. Also an independent variable and a dependent variable.
1894	1	2	In order for me to repeat the expiriment I would need to know a little bit more information such as, how much of each substance to use, how much vinegar to use and what the temperature should be when letting the samples out in containers. This person has to be a lot more specific in his procedure very hard to follow
1895	1	3	They would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup, what sample material would be, determine the temp that the samples should dry at.
1896	1	1	The additional information you would and to replicate this experiment is you would need a lot of materials,you would need to see the student observations and you would need to see the conclusion. Bassicaly a written lab report would be the best tool in recreating this experiments.
1897	1	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I need to know how much vinegar do I need to pour in the containers. I need to know what the sample of the minerals are and I also need to know how I'm going to measure the mass.
1898	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment , you will need to record the mass 8 of different samples. You also need to pour the vinegar into the separate containers you use hea to wait 24 hours are you have to let the sample dry for a while , then you determine the mass.
1899	1	1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would alst be to have the same amount of vinegar in each of the sample cups, to have an equal effect, 2nd would be to have the same amount of the sample, get the same starting mass for all 4 so in the end you can use which sample was effected the most. Finally, you should subtract the starting mass from the end mass to get the difference to see which was affected most by the substance.
1900	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, you would also need to know what temperature the room they are left in , should be overnight and how much distilled water to use when rinsing the samples.
1901	1	1	How much vinigar is in each container? What type of wood? What is the control?
1902	1	1	Additional information needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers. Another piece of information that is missing is how much is a sample of each material. Finally you would repeat the experiment a couple of times to see if your results change.
1903	1	1	I wan need to know what samples to use co i need a graph of some sat to record the starting and ending mass. What unit of mass do the samples need to be weighed in.
1904	1	1	To do replication of the experiment you would need measure how much vinegar are dropping.The other stones have already been used and cannot be used again. You also need to have a triple beam balance to be able to see how much each stone eventually weighed.Finally you would need to test them what they need to each sample for a separate 30 minutes, unless they all get different in at the same time.
1905	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment, I need wood, plastic, limestone, marble and vinegar. Also, I would need water to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hour soak.
1906	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to what the sample are that are using. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four samples. I would also need to know what I must use to take out the sample. would I use my hands or tongs?
1907	1	2	if I were to replicate this, I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each cup, do you put different amount in different cups? Also where should I put the cups to rest, inside, outside? Would that have differen out comes?
1908	1	3	This procedure lacks important details and is not in order. Step one is too similar to step 6. Need to specify what kind of different samples, and how to determine the beginning mass. Step two needs to include the specific amount of vinegar for each container. The procedure should include the size needed for the samples to get accurate results. Step 3 should state what to label the containers with which information. In step 6, they should include how to calculate the mass, for example subtract beginning mass from end mass. Add, record data results.
1909	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar was put into the container and what type of coma were used to hold the samples i would also need to know what the purpose of this experiment is in other words what is the group of studen is trying to prove?
1910	1	2	1. How much vinegar do you put into the different containers. 2. How large is the sample being used. ^p 3.The dependent or the dependant
1911	1	2	One piece of information that should be included is the amount of vinegar necessary in each cup. Also, how the material's mass is determined should be included. Lastly, how big the material is should be stated.
1912	1	1	In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need the temperature of the vinegar. The amount of vinegar poured into each container and the amount of samples needed (how much needed.
1913	1	0	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is steps 1-6 because there importan to make the table acecit. You woud also need to make other table to show you resits and other infomation.
1914	1	1	The group needs to provide how much vinegar is being poured into the containers.The amount of vinegar can change the exeperiment.
1915	1	3	How much vinegar, how big should the containers be and how big should the samples be are all additional information you would need to recreate this experiment.
1916	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment the person may need a diagram of the experiment. The person needs the promble or statement to determine what they maybe testing for. Also they need the list of materials they have to use in order to do the experiment.
1917	1	0	You will need to explain what is happening with the vinegar. What happen to the sample after it drys,  and what the experiment looks like
1918	1	1	They need to say how much vinegar to put in each container. The also need to say where to put the label on the material itself, on the cup, or on the table in front of the cup. Laslty they need to say how to remove the materials from the containers, do they use their fingers or tongs.
1919	1	1	To replicate the experiment the group would need to better state the problem. Give an amount of vinegar to put in the containers and lastly use more then one trial.
1920	1	1	Information that would be needed in the procedure would be the name of the sample material. Also you'll need when and how to measure the mass of materials. This information is needed to replicate the experiment.
1921	1	1	How much vinegar, what kind of scale.
1922	1	1	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on the rocks, the purpose of this experiment, and a control variable.
1923	1	0	Three pieces of information I would need to replicate the experiment are vinegar to pour into the containers. A scale to weight the mass and find thedifference  at the end of the experiment and distilled water to rinse each sample with.
1924	1	1	In this procedure they leave out some thing that makes it im possible to recreate quantitys' it says nothing about how much vinegar or rock sam plquantity also using cleaner numbers would make iteasyer to recreate and read.
1925	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment you need to have information. Some example of things you would need to no is how much vinegar is being poured in each of the seperate containers. Another thing that you would need to no is the volume of each substance because the surface area will effect how much is eroded off. Another thing where you let the samples sit for 30 minutes because there might be difference in temperature effecting how much it drys.
1926	1	3	The additional information that needed to be included are what the samples are. The amount of vinegar poured into the containers in step 2 also need to be known. Another part that needs more information is how much of each sample needs to be placed in the container in step 3. Another part of this experiment that needs more information is step 2, what type of container should the samples be placed into.
1927	1	3	One piece of information i would need is what are the four different samples. Another piece of information is how much vinegar i need to pour into each container. The third piece of information i would need is how much and how long should i rinse each sample with distilled water. Another piece of information you could use is at what temperature conditions are the samples left to sit and dry in.
1928	1	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment, you will need top know how much vinegar is being used, how long you rinse each sample and conditions the samples are drying in.
1929	1	2	You would need to know what to take samples of. The procedure isn't specific in what materials are being weighed. You would also need to know any safety procedures to be taken while conducting this experiment. Also, the procedure does not give a specific place to leave the containers. Additionally the procedure should tell the dimentions of the samples so that their volumes are all the same.
1930	1	0	The additional information you would need to know is the shape, size, and liquid.
1931	1	1	To secrefullu replicate the procedure I or anybody else would need the following information. First a statement that will tell me what. I am doing the lala for. Amaterials list will also be needed. Last I would need a better procedure that is
1932	1	3	In order to better replicate this expiriment, the students must also tell us the amount ofvinegar poured into each cup (m/s), the amount of water used to rinse the materials (in m/s) and the time given to rinsing (how long may each container rinsed in water).
1933	1	2	In the procedure number I doesn't explain what four different samples to use. Another thing the procedure could have said was to list what materials to use. After reading this procedure I would be able to replicate this experiment. Not knowing how much vinegar to pour in might mass up this experiment.
1934	1	2	Some additional information thut hey coold put in the data is how much vinegar they pot in the container and another thing that they could say is about the temperature of the room or the vinegar.
1935	1	0	The three additional information that can be added is the control of the experiment,the students could've done these with a warm temperature and one with cold. Lastly,they could have used regular water than distilled water.
1936	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment. You would need the names of the samples you must use the measurements for the vinegar and the measurements (amounts) for each sample.
1937	1	2	Some additional information the group could add is how much vinegar your supposed to put in each container. In addition, this group could also include the size of the container they're using. Finally i think they should have been a little more specific with their steps.
1938	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment additional information you would need is, what do you use to measure the mass, tell it in your procedure. Tell the reader how much vinegar to put in each of the containers in step 2. Also tell the reader where do you place the containers after they have been rinsed' do you place them in a cold area, hot area or room temperature. This could mess up the experiment if you are not told this.
1939	1	2	Identify what are the four rocks they are going to use and if its all different shapes. Also tell if the contaners are the same size or not?
1940	1	1	I think that they need to show how many cups they have the amount of vinegar and how much of the materials that they are using for there experiment.
1941	1	3	The additional information i would need to replicate the experiment, i would need to know what the four different samples so i can test the same thing. The seconds to saw vinegar to pour into the containers all the samples have the same quality level. You say this is to say now long tonne earn sample so the vinegar can wash off.
1942	1	3	There is a lot of additional information one would need to repeat this experiment. First, the students should include the different names for the four samples in order for proper replication. Furthermore, the students should include the amount of vinegar that should be poured into the containers. The size of the sample should also be indicated in the procedure. Furthermore, it would be best if the size of the container was provided in the procedure.
1943	1	0	Acid rain. ^p Will repeat some samples, make data, and check if the experiment is correct.
1944	1	2	In the procedure it is not included how they determined the mass of the samples or what the samples were (step 3). Also, it is not stated in step 6 how to determine the mass. The temperature of the distilled water is not defined at constant in step 4. The location or temperature of the place where the four substances in step 4 are not defined nor the temperature of where they are drying in step 5.
1945	1	1	The additional information that I would need would be the materials. So that we would know what we need to do the experiment. We need a desk explanation as to why we are determinig the mass of each sample.
1946	1	2	Additional information that I would need inorder to conduct this experiment is what different kinds of samples how much vinegar to pour into each cup and also what to label the cups if I dont have any of this my experiment won't be valid. I need to know the independent and dependent variable and whats has to be constant. Another thing is what are we using to weigh the samples with.
1947	1	1	You would need to know what you are using what the samples are. You would need to know what you are mixing the vinegar with such as if the cup is empty or if there is water or something in there. And you would need to know when you start the experiment.
1948	1	0	In group's acid rain procedure, the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the mass they started of in how long after to remove the samples from the container and the time to allow the samples to sit and dry.
1949	1	0	Instead of vinegar they should put a different kind of liquid to test with. Also instead of leaving it for 24 hours leave it for 48 to see if there would be a certain change in mass. Also when samples are ready to sit and dry leave them there for 45 instead of 30 minutes.
1950	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar, temperature of the vinegar.
1951	1	0	I would say wood because the mass difference is 0.On the starting mass is 11.2, so is the end of the mass 11.2
1952	1	1	This group gave some of the information but not all because they didn't say how much viniger they put in the container. And the only did 2 trail,3 trail is what it needed to be and the calculation cannot be accura because how they going to leave, it in over min and then come back the next day and give oe say has the got their calculations for are not enough into.
1953	1	1	1st you would need to know what is they were trying to figure not ^p ,2nd you need to know what material they are going to use ,3rd i would need  to know what there conclusion is
1954	1	1	In order to replicate it would mean that you would be more detailed and tell if the object is a solid, liquid, or gas its state of form and if it can move or its unmovable and describe the item or what type of item it is
1955	1	0	1.You would need to measure the starting mass. ^p 2.You would need to measure the ending mass. ^p 3.You would need to measure the difference between the starting and ending mass.
1956	1	1	The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is you would need to know the name of the samples that you putting in the container. You would also have to label the sample when you remove them from there containers.
1957	1	1	The additional information I would need is how much vinegar I would have to put into each sample. Also in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much of a sample I needed in order to accuratey results. The group also needs a problem question becouse another scientist might want to know why someone wants to do this experiment and what the other scientist  was trying to determine or prove. Also I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
1958	1	3	One thing you could change is the amount of vinegar, the sample size, and were you dry it because of the temp.
1959	1	2	To replicate the experiment, You would need to know how much of each sample was used, how warm the vinegar is, and how much vinegar to put .
1960	1	2	Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is, the amount of vinegar needed, the size of the cups and also a control to see just how effective this experiment is.
1961	1	1	To replicate the experiment in the procedure they need to be more suspific as to say what the four different samples are. They should also be more suspific on how they measure the mass. The third thing they should do is told which material they were using and then said reapet steps 3-6 so that it is clearer and easier to understand.
1962	1	2	One piece of information would be how much vinegar to pour into the four containers. Another piece of information would be how much of the sample materials to place into the containers so all four containers don't have an advantage or disadvantage because of unequal amounts. A last piece of info. would be what temperature to keep the containers in.
1963	1	2	You would need to know what samples you are using, how to determine the mass of them and what containers you must use.
1964	1	2	I would need to know
1965	1	1	An additional piece of information you would need to replicate the experiment is the temperature of the enviroment the samples are in because they already have the starting mass, ending mass and the time period.
1966	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar the group of students how poured into the containers. Secondly, what kind of containers did the students use. Thirdly, what expecting is in the sample itself.
1967	1	1	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what to weigh the objects that I am testing with. I also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and also the unit of measure that I am measuring the vinegar with.
1968	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, I think I  need to know: ^p (1) How much vinegar did they pour into each containers. ^p (2) Is every containers get same amount of vinegar. ^p (3) Is every samples sit and dry in same environment.
1969	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what amount of each sample to use, where to to dry the samples, and how big the containers should be.
1970	1	1	Some additional information would be, what samples are going into the cups, also how much of each sample are in a cup and why are they doing this experiment.
1971	1	0	This is not a clear statement of the experiments. Aclear statement of the problem would include an explation of why students were pavestigation and the fain.
1972	1	0	The mass is ending 9.4 and of the wood is 11.2 in who the two are difference at the mass and at wood because have different peso.
1973	1	3	In this procedure, there are a esuple pieces of information that should be included. They should tell you how much vinegar you use and if it is the same amount for each sample. Also . it should tell you to record the data of starting mass, they could tell you how long to rinse the sample and the names of the samples could be included in the procedure. Finally, at the end of the procedure, it should tell you to record your data and find the difference in the masses.
1974	1	0	Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be to add more materials to the experiment. Adding different kinds of pack could influence other materials in the experiment. Another peice of information to be considered would be to increase the time the materials are soaked in the vinegar. This would probably have an increased affect on the materials. Another peice of information would be to do more trials. This would help with pinpointing the exact affect vinegar has on these materials.
1975	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are a balance scale, how much space in containers and how much mass used.
1976	1	0	I would add water because it would be less lighter than the rest of the stuff.
1977	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container, how to determine the mass of the samples and what type of vinegar is being used. I would also need to know how to name and rinse each sample and how to dispose of the vinegar waste. Lastly, for is important to know the texture and distribution of each sample a container. For example, if the limestone was crushed and poured in the vinegar container it would dissolve much faster.
1978	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment u would have to try & use many different samples. Another way they can do this is to be more pacific on the data, by telling us how many cups of vinergen is needed.
1979	1	2	Additional information we would need is the type of samples in order to replicate the experiment, knowing how much vinegar to add in four seperate identical containers would also need to know how to measure the samples masses. All this helps to replicate the experiment.
1980	1	2	To replicate a better experiment, the first thing you would want to add is how much vinegar is poured in each container. If one container has more than the other, more will erode the material quicker giving inaccurate results. Another factor they may want to change to the same weight and size of the material once again isn't going to give you good results. Lastly, they shouldn't use the already used material to replicate the experiment. Some materials are weaker than others and may erode quicker, so those are all factors the group of students should add.
1981	1	3	The first piece of information that is nesessary to repeat this experiment, if only given the procedure, is what the four samples are. We would also need to know how much vinegar to place in each container. We would also need to know if the containers needed to be opened or closed during the twenty-four hour period.
1982	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know opromatly the size of the sample used so that i would achieve similar results. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar poured into each of the four containers, I need to know this because different amounts of vinegar may cause more or less of a change in mass. Another thing that i would need to know is the environment that the samples are to sit in, the temperature and lighting could effect my results. Lastly, I would need to know if the containers are covered or left open, if they are left open some of the vinegar could evaporte, thus effecting my results.
1983	1	0	"They would need to explain how their experiment went. So they used different objects and put them in containers with vinegar to soc. Determine the mass of each. So this is how they should explain their experiment. ""We've tested four objects in vinegar and the four objects were a marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The mass of each were marble 4.8, limestone 10.4, wood 11.6 and plastic 7.2. When we put them in the vinegar and took them out and set them down for 30 minutes we saw that the mass of the marble went down to 9.4, limestone 9.1, wood 11.2, and plastic 7.1. So the mass of the marble went down -0.4, limestone -1.3, wood 0.0, and plastic -0.1."
1984	1	3	What  additional information we will need is how much vinegar they used, what kind of vinegar they used, and how big and what kind of containers they used, they should also have a control group plus, they should tell for how big each sample is.
1985	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, the additional information that is needed is to record exactly how much vinegar needs to be poured into each container. Another piece of additional information that is needed is how to determine the initial mass of each sample. It is also necessary to be specific and state exactly which material (marble, limestone, wood, or plastic) should be placed into each container.
1986	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container, you  would need to know what the four different samples were, and you would need to know whether or not  to cover or put a lid on the containers.
1987	1	0	You need a grab for the chart.
1988	1	2	The procedure did not say what types of cocks shuld be used in this experiment. The procdure also does not state hou much vinegar buc in the cups. At the end of the procedure it should say repeat experiment for better results.
1989	1	1	They should have done more trials for each sample to make sure it is accurat. Also there should be the same amount of vinegar for each sample. It should say put each sample in the same size contaner and cover the sample with vinegar or say how much vinegar to use.
1990	1	3	Firstly, the students need to be clearer with their procedure.The amount of vinegar to pour on the samples can dramatically alter the results, so an exact amount is desireable.how big are the containers, the size matters when replicating.Another necessity in replication of this experiment is the time used to rinse the samples, they all must be the same
1991	1	2	How much of a sample to put in the container. Also, how much big were the containers? And how much vinegar should be used?
1992	1	1	Should try different samples for each container. ^p Another suggestion let it sit and dry for different time. ^p Another, make sure is the same temperature.
1993	1	0	I think that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure tell what we were getting the mass of, Also they should have once more trials each , why this observation was being done.
1994	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar I needed to pour into the containers, It would also be good to say what they are using to determine the mass of the I object whether it was a triple beam balance or an cetric balance finally in order to replicate the experiment they would need to tell me what the samore are because it all know is four different sample I'm not going to know they mean marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
1995	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to use, what form each sample is in, and the type of vinegar that was used for the experiment.
1996	1	1	The additional information needed to replicate the experiment would first be how much vinegar to pour into the cups and the units in which to measure the rocks mass and vinegar.They would also have to include the purpose of the experiment so others understand the experiment better.
1997	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment more information could be needed. The procedure would that base to
1998	1	3	To be able to replicate the folowing experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to place  in each container.I would also need to know what samples to use. Where do I put the containers for 24 hours.
1999	1	2	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar that goes in each cup, also the need to list the material and they need to add the mass object w.
2000	1	1	You would need to have a control to determine what you are doing the experiment for. The students would also need to have a dependant variable as well as a dependant variable. The students also need to state what they are testing in the experiment.
2001	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what the four different samples were because they did not mention them in the procedure. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container, I would need to know how big the containers were.
2002	1	1	The three different peices of information you would need is what samples are you using for the experiment. The second thing you would need to measure the mass on a scale before measuring it after the 24 hours. And the third reason is subtract the starting mass from the ending mass to get the difference between them.
2003	1	2	Some information I would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was used, what to measure the mass of he samples with, and how long should the sambes be rinsed with distilled water.
2004	1	3	After reading the students procedure, one thing I  would add is the amount of vinegar to add to each sample. Another thing I would add in the procedure is the size of the container they want the samples in, and if they should be covered. The last thing I'd have the students add to their procedure is the actual samples themselves so that the person can know what substances they are testing. If all those things were done, the experiment would go a lot smoother, and the results would be a lot more accurate.
2005	1	2	The information needed to replicate this experiment is to identify the different samples and how to make them. They would need to specify how much vinegar to pour into the containers, also be more clear about the control in the experiment.
2006	1	2	The additional information you could add are how much of the vinegar do we add to the containers or what kind of vinegar to add because they don't say this in the procedure. Also when to start ,they don't tell you when to start or to end they only said after 24 hours remove the samples. They also don't tell you how or when to record the mass of the object they just say rinse containers and let them dry.Also they need to run two more test.
2007	1	0	You would need to know the age of the samples because if the wood is old and dried out it'll absorb some of the vinegar.
2008	1	2	Additional information the students should include ares 1.) What is the problem they are trying to solve, 2.) List of materials, 3.)Amount of viniger.
2009	1	2	On order to replicate the experiment,
2010	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, the additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment includes how much of each sample to use because without having the same amount of sample, you don't know wether the mass difference is due to composition or amount, the same applies to the vinegar, without knowing how much vinegar to pour into the cups, one might be affected more because it has more vinegar in it than the others. This can also apply to the distilled water, without knowing how long to rinse or how much water to use, one sample might be affected more.
2011	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know if there were any other factors while you left it sitting such as temperature. Sunlight also you need to know the independent and dependant variable.
2012	1	3	To complete this experiment again, the cares of the samples should have been stated at the beginning with at knowing knowing what the samples are, how are you suppost to experiment on them. There should be a list of all the things that you will need during this experiment. And there should be more details like, what kind of measurement are you measuring the mass, or what kind of container is it, or were do you store the experiment for those 24 hours.
2013	1	3	a) Size of the containers, types of containers. ^p b) Amount of vinegar. ^p c) Size of the samples.
2014	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment correctly, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers.You would also need to know what unit of measurement has to be used to measure the sample. Finally,you would need to know what kind of containers were used and if they would effect the masses or the samples.
2015	1	0	In this lab the information you would need in order to replicate the experiment again you should have a control. Another think is that how many samples to put in one container. Also, you would need distilled water.
2016	1	3	The three imost they had bett.where how much vinegar did they use for the experiment. Also, that they forgot to saw how big containers were and if they cover the container after they put the vinegar and materials.
2017	1	3	In addition, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the four containers, also the size of the containers and how much of the sample was put into each container.
2018	1	0	Some additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be certain amount of vinegarI would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
2019	1	1	The additional information you need would be the materials needed for the experiment, the problem that you are experimenting, dependent variable, independent variable, and even a graph to explain their results better.
2020	1	0	They need the data to add of each experiment, need hypothesys.
2021	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what are the different samples that I am investigating? I would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples. The group needs to clarify that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. And you measure the mass using a scale and in grams. Lastly, I need to know how much vinegar to put in each container to replicate this experiment.
2022	1	2	In orderd to replicate this experiment, the additional information required includes;the amount of vinegar poured into containers,the location where the containers were started and the instrument used to prepare the mass of samples,either a laple temprereture digital scales.
2023	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, also how much water you place into each sample and you would need to record step 3 more clearly.
2024	1	2	To replicate the experiment, I would first off need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples. For the next step, would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the pieces of material. I would want to know how exactly to rinse the seperate slabs at the end and then know how to measure the mass of the seperate samples at the end as well.
2025	1	0	This procedure is not descriptive at all. Wedon't even know what to use for the first step. It also doesn't say the exact amount of what everything should be. The last mistake it states to label but we are not sure of the exact name. So all of these mistakes would need to be fixed.
2026	1	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples I am sopost to use, how much vinegar I'm sopost to put in these samples and what I'm supost to look them.
2027	1	0	You will need to write a hypothesis on the experiment and a conclusion on what happened and a graph on the changes that the experiment went through.
2028	1	2	To replicate this experiment I would have to know what kind of container they used and the size of it, also I would have to know where I should remove the samples to after 24 hours.
2029	1	1	They should have wrote in the 4 different sample telling us what they are. Also they told us to determine the mass but they didn't tell us to fing the difference in mass from the starting mass to the end mass.
2030	1	1	To replicate the experiment again. I would need to know how much vinegar used, I would need to have a control group like marbles, limestone, wood and plastic placed in a distilled water esp for 24 hours to test my results again. And lastly, I would need all the materials to weigh the same before starting the experiment.
2031	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar they used and what shape the samples were in. i If they were all marble shaped the results would very from a jaged figure.
2032	1	0	I would need them to explain to me how they got the conclusion (mass of the 4 samples). ^p Then I would tell them to include procedure step by step throught the exsperiment. ^p How much acid rain was need to effect the mass.
2033	1	2	To replicate this experiment you will need to know the name of the material.How much vinegar to actually pour in the containers. What is the name of the sample material.
2034	1	3	To replicate the experiment, the group would need to state the amount of vinegar that is to be poured into the containers. The group also needs to state if the containers should be covered and at what temperature the containers should be stored.
2035	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what is the statement that they are trying prove. Also how much vinegar was added to each container. Finally each starting mass should be the same.
2036	1	1	It would be very helpful if you knew what the mass was at the end of the expiriment. It also should show exactly how much vinegar you should pour into each container. In that case you can have an exact amount each time. Also it would help to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic we have in each container.
2037	1	2	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be what you would use to find the mass, how much vineger to pour in the containers; and where should the samples lit for 30 minutes? in the heat? in the reid?
2038	1	3	"To replicate the experiment more information is needed such as, the amount of vinegar in each cup, what the samples are, how long the samples should be rinsed and clearer directions instead of saying, "" pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers,"" explain how much vinegar and whether cups should be large or small. The experiment procedure needs to be more specific so that more trials can be done exactly the same or as close as possible, for a more accurate conclusion."
2039	1	0	Some additional information that they would need to replicate the experiment is to add the starting mass with the ending mass. Then they get an answer and then they divide that answer with the answer in the distance in mass numbers.
2040	1	2	The next time this group did this experiment, they would get more accurate results by measuring and recording the amount of vinegar poured into each container. They should also record the temperature of at which the containers are stored. This information will improve the accuracy of the results, and will make it easier to repeat the experiment.
2041	1	1	To replicate the group's procedure,the students will need to tell how much vinegar goes into the identical contaicee. Also they would need to tell how much distilled water would need to be added.
2042	1	3	In this groups,  procedure you wuld need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in container and also what kind of container. Also they could add what temprature they left the material in the containers.
2043	1	3	After reading the groups procedure, in order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar was needed, how big was the sample pieces and did need to be close to sunlight or just room light.
2044	1	1	To replicate this experiment well you would need to know more information. The procedure did not tell you how much vinegar to put in each container. The procedure also didn't explain that you should weigh the samples in grams before you begin. An experiment that is replicated may not always be exact, but the important information should be included.
2045	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, additional information needed would be the volume of vinegar. Also, the procedure should say if the containers are covered or uncovered. Finally, it should specify what the samples should dry in, like a petri dish, to avoid contamination.
2046	1	1	One thing that's need to be done to the procedure is get safety goggles because it's always important to be safe. Another thing that's needed to be put is gathering materials you need. Also the last thing to be done is when your finished with an experiment, clean up your area.
2047	1	1	Some additional information I would like to add to this Acid Rain experiment is to tell what amount or how much vinegar to place in the containers. Another  suggestion is to add more detail to the first step by agknowledging what samples we have to determine the mass or. They might also want to include what or how to determine the mass of each of the samples.
2048	1	3	Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be to know what the four different samples are that are being tested. Another piece of additional information needed is the amount of vinegar being poured in step 2. One other piece of additional info would be how long to rinse the samples in distilled water,and what temperature the water should be at while rinsing.
2049	1	0	A proceder that I would put in that after they all dryed, then I out them on a balance beam scale and then add 4 different mass from starting mass.
2050	1	1	Additional info needed to replicate the experiment are say what sample types your using, I tell you how to set up the cups, and describe about the samples.If the group did these things I would be able to copy this experiment.
2051	1	0	This is a good procedure to follow, only it lacks of some problems towards the end, which cause the experiment to completly go wrong, because of the fact that you will be unable to finish the investigation. I myself would not change but rather much could a step or two by the procedure, for example it is necessary to comprare all the answers with one another by subtracting and seeing each others differences, and 8. Depend exparament al least three times to see if it is valid.
2052	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four seperate but identical containers. I would also need to know what the four samples were even though it is stated in the data table, it is not stated in the procedure where it should be stated. Another thing would be helpful to know is what types of container I should I put the samples in so that I can replicate the experiment the same way they performed it.
2053	1	2	After reading the group's procedure the additional information i would need in order to replicate the experiment is specify, types of materials like what kind of wood or plastic did they use because there are different kinds. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use for each material because that information was not given and using different amounts of vinegar can affect the results.
2054	1	0	Additional information you would need would be your independent variable, dependent variable, control and you would have to form a hypothesis. The independent dont variable is what you control and the dependent variable depends on the I.V.
2055	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what materials were being used. In the procedure, the group wasn't clear on what substances they were using. Also, the group needs to tell you to find the difference between the 2 mases. They were not clear on that in the procedure
2056	1	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in, what samples you would use and what the independent variables could be.
2057	1	2	First they would need to list the four sample names so I know what I am working with. Second, list down the mass of each sample. Finally, list down either you put samples under heat, cold, where ?
2058	1	3	First are they didn't fell you to put on your safety gageles. Then they determine the mass of four different samples are of what to use to get the mass with the next step it doesn't say what kind of containers to use. Glass or metal or raind or savare, i also don't know what to label. Do you put it on a paper tawel to dry also because it doesn't say how to.
2059	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, you will need to know how many pieces of each sample are going to be added. You would also need to know the conditions of the resting place because they can affect the experiment. In addition, It would also be useful to know how the amounts are being measured.
2060	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment additional information I would need  would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. To make sure there is only one independent variable, the material, the amount of vinegar in each cup must be the same. Also, the temperature of the room should be identified, because it have a possible effect on the outcome. Last, the volume of each material needs to be specified should be identical.
2061	1	1	In order to complete this experiment, they need to inquire measurements of how much vinegar to put in the cups and how much of each sample should go into the cup. Also, they forget to tell you to get a starting mass, so you are capable of finding the difference between the starting and ending mass.
2062	1	1	In the groups procedure, they need to add additional information. They need to add 1) gather materials then they should list the materials needed.2) List the 4 different samples, also they should add.5)record data, they should add these three things because you should write a procedure very detailed because some people might not understand.
2063	1	2	I would need to know what kind of samples will I need. I would also need to know how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. Most importantly, I'm going to need to know what to use to figure out the mass.
2064	1	1	You would need the names of everything and the numbers that go with it so that everyone understands what youre trying to explain to them.
2065	1	0	To make the experiment able to be replicated, there can be a different amount of time. There can also be more containers which lastly there can be different placements, such as one container can be in the sun, another can be in the shade. Or simply there can be a temperature differences instead of measuring the mass. All these factors can make this experiment reprodurable.
2066	1	0	Additional information I will need in order to replcate this experiment is how long you leave the vinegar in the four different samples, how many times you have to do it for and how you measure the mass.
2067	1	0	We need more, starting mass, ending mass & difference in mass & then test it all over.
2068	1	0	It is a good statemen ot the problem cause is showing u every thing they did and every color, temperatur after s minutes and every temp after 16 minutes.
2069	1	0	I think in order to replicate the experiment you would have to change the data recorded for this experiment.
2070	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know what the samples are of. We would also need to know why we are massing these samples; what are we trying to find. Thirdly, we need to know where to put the containers, the environment must affect the experiment in one way or the another.
2071	1	0	I don't know.
2072	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what materials to use. Also how much of each material? For example step 2 indicates to pour vinegar in container. How much vinegar should I pour? Another thing I would need to know, how to determine things and it what units I should. For example step 1 indicates to determine the mass of four different samples. It also never specifies type of samples.
2073	1	1	You need to know what the samples are. ^p You need to put the starting mass of the samples and record the ending mass.
2074	1	2	They would need to include how much vinegar they are pouring into each containers, name the samples that they are going to use min their procedure and they should also say if they have any constants. Those are some ways in which their procedure would be well.
2075	1	2	Additional information needed, would first be what the four different samples are. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each containers. In the procedure it says to place sample in a container since they haven't said what samples there are people wouldn't be able to replicate this experiment, there's  not enough information, and that wouldn't give the most accurate results.
2076	1	2	To begin with the procedure should state how much vinegar should be used in the cups also, it should specify merisseds or materials in this cups
2077	1	1	What is the reasoning for doing this experiment?, what kind of container should we use?, What should we use to determine mass before and after.
2078	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, it is necessary to know exactly how much vinegar was put into each container. Also, what type of containers were used. Also, what would need to be known is how much water was used to rinse it off.
2079	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, some additional information I would need would be what the 4 different samples were. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour in the cups. Lastly, I would know how much of the sample I would be weighing whether it be 50z, or 51bs the sample is not clear in the procedure.
2080	1	0	To repeat this experiment, you would need  have valid data, a control and more trials. Also I would put the four samples of vinegar in different environments such as a refrigarator or incubator. To see if the data would be affected.
2081	1	2	The students could include what the four samples actually were. The students should also label the identical containers so they don't get mixed up. The students should also include what device they're finding the mass of the samples with. The students should also include how much vinegar should be poured into each container.
2082	1	1	You will need the same amount of the experience because it is the main part of the experience and also measure haw much sample/ or vinegar you using and water/check it out often times to see if anything will happen.
2083	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used, what temperature the room in which the samples were and how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample . Another factor you should know to replicate the experiment was if the corner used was dark or if sunlight touched the rocks during the experiment.
2084	1	2	The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is 1) how much would all the samples weigh? ^p 2) How much vinegar do I pour in the containers? And 3) Where would this experiment take place. What kind of surroundings and environment?
2085	1	0	In the experiment limestone has the most different in the mass. Wood didn't change at all. The mass stayed the same. Wood had highest starting and ending mass. To make this experiment better they could of had more trial.
2086	1	1	You would need to include how much vinegar you need to put in the containers. They also need to include the formula for determining the mass. Also they need to include how much material we need.
2087	1	3	To replicate this experiment you would have to no the amount and mass of the vinegar. You would also have to no the temperature of the vinegar and the temperature when the stones were drying. Another piece of information needed is the ph of the vinegar. You would also have to no what type of wood used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also have to no the type of plastic.
2088	1	3	To replicate this experiment you would require a few more pieces of information. For example, how much vinegar to put in. That piece of information is never mentioned in the procedure, and it is very important to ensure validity. Another piece of information needed is a supply list. It is never stated with what you are supposed to determine the mass and the only supplies mentioned are the 4 ''containers'' and an unidentified amount of vinegar. Also, where the containers should be kept is never mentioned, because if they are stored incorrectly it might cause the experiment to be invalid.
2089	1	1	Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment is, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container.
2090	1	2	The students could have said how much vinegar they put into the containers. They also could have said how big or small the containers were.
2091	1	3	Some additional info that I would need for this experiment is the temp that they would have the containers in. Also another piece of info I would need is how much vinegar I should put in. And last info that I would need is should the room I leave them in be light, dark or should it be moderate. All this to make the experiment reenactment accurate.
2092	1	2	The group of students should have mentioned in their procedures what four samples to use in the experiment. Otherwise, the experiment wouldn't be able to be replicated because we don't know which sample to use. Also, they should've mentioned the amount of vinegar that should've been poured in each of the four containers so we know how much to pour in. They should also have mentioned whether or not we had to record the difference in the mass of the samples or not.
2093	1	0	To replicate this experiment you would need to have a starting mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic to do this you would also need to use the group's procedure.
2094	1	2	To replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the four different samples are, you also need to know the starting mass for each sample, how to determine the mass of each sample and where to keep the containers for the 24 hours.
2095	1	1	In step number 5, you should specify where to let the samples is and dry. Make sure it is not too cold or too hot. In step 2, you should include how much vinegar to pour into each container. In step 1 and 6, you should describe how to find the mass of the samples.
2096	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment there needs to be how much vinegar to use.
2097	1	1	In the group procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container,how to determine the mass and what to label each container in order to replicate the experiment.
2098	1	1	When the tell you to determin the mass of four different samples they should say starting mass. In step two they should say how much vinegar to pour into all containers. The should include determine the ending mass.
2099	1	3	You would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar is used, and how to dry them.
2100	1	2	After reading the groups procedure in order to replicate is one must add three things such as amount of vinegar poured into the containers, need a scale and a type of vinegar.
2101	1	1	I would neet to know the samples, a discription of them, in order to do the investigation, in order to make it clear and understandable.
2102	1	2	I would need to get a lsit of all the different materials. I would also had to know how much vingar to use also one else ending results might not be as others. I would also need to folow how much
2103	1	2	Yow'd need to know how muchvinegar was poured into each sample. You'd needto know how much of each sample you'd need, how long should you rinse it.
2104	1	1	The students have neglected to include the amount of vinegar and it is hard to replicate the lab without measurements. The students should also include other trials and also if the vinegar needs to be replaced. These are important to procure correct results.
2105	1	0	You would need to find out what the mass is (question 1 ), we would also need to know what the remaining samples are (question 2). Lastly, we would want to answer question 6 and find out the mass.
2106	1	1	To repeat this groops procedure, you would need 3 additional pieces of information. ^p              1. The amount of vinegar to put on the sample. ^p               2. The amount of each sample that you need. ^p                3. The amount of distilled water to rinse each sample.
2107	1	3	Reading the group's procedure it should have been more thorough for me to replicate that experiment. They needed to included in their procedure, the 4 types of samples that were experimenting on.The amount of vinegar used in their experiment, the types of containers that were used and the size of each container. They also needed to include the name of the sample that should be poured into container and also which container. Also where were the containers left to dry the temperature of the atmosphere outside or inside, for me to be able to replicate this experiment.
2108	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar you are pouring into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is how much of a sample you put into the labled container. Finally, at the end you should use the same amount of distilled water to rinse off the vinegar at the end.
2109	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment, the group would need to specify in number one the four different samples. In step 3, they need to specify which sample goes into which container,and lastly, they should add another step which should state that they should run atleast 3 trials so that their information could be accurate.
2110	1	0	The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is 1:I have to get all the ingredient for the experiment .2: Later  I have to put all the ingredients to ge ther and I have to show how  to prepare the experiments.Then iI all the ingredient and I have to know how to prepare the experiment and later I have to give the time necesary and for the end I have to check was what the result.
2111	1	1	First you have to determine the samples name. Predict the mass so when the right answer comes up you dont get shocked. At the end of the procedure compare them to your prediction.
2112	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determine the mass of the four different samples 2 times of four vinegar in each of four seperate but identical container 2 times. Next,place a sample of one material into one container 2 times. Then repeat with the remaining samples and place a single sample into a single container. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min then determine the mass of each sample.
2113	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four containers. The amount of vinegar would affect the difference of mass and time. Also, I would need to know what kinds of containers it use for placing the samples in. Some containers might not allow enough room for the samples. Lastly I would need to know how much distilled water I would need to rinse the  substances with.This could change the difference in mass.
2114	1	2	To improve the groups experiments they would need to add to the procedure how they found the difference in masses. Also the group should include clearly when the started recording and when they stoped recording. Finally, to improve these students labs I think the should expain the list of materials they were using and its size.
2115	1	2	One thing we would need to know in the procedure is how much vinegar to pour in the containers. If we don't know how much vinegar to put in the results would end up differently. Another thing we would need to know is what size of container to put the vinegar in, we would also need to know what object to put in what amount of vinegar.
2116	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar was present in the containers and the size of the rock sample to assure that the rock came in contact with the same amount of vinegar on it's surface in both experiments. I would also want to know they type of vinegar so I could use the same kind.
2117	1	3	In order to replicate the lab that the students made, the procedure for you would have to know, what kind of materials you are using for the practical to place in the vinegar. Also, you would need to measure what after placing below, you should go through before including the labs. You also need to know how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to use.
2118	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment, they should also put so the procedure, how much vinegar so the amount of liquid is equal, where they should sit & dry (a window, canter, if its on anything, under a light etc.) How do you rinse it with distilled water( also you use soap, let it sank to get vinegar out or do you dump water on it then let it dry).
2119	1	1	The exact amount vinegar poured in each container. How to measure the amount of mass each has.
2120	1	2	The amount of vinegar, the temperature of the room, and the marble should be the same size.
2121	1	2	You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the different samples. You would need to know also what one marene, you put into the container and label, and you would need to know exactly what material you put  with each samples.
2122	1	2	The groups procedure is, although somewhat thorough hard to replicate. In order foreach sample to get the same treatment and be as accurate as possible you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you also would need to know how much water to rinse with. The right factor is also important. The students should be more specific about where the samples should be put, rather light or dark, because this effects the outcome.
2123	1	2	Some additional information needed to repeat this process would be how much vinegar to put in each container, if we should let the samples sit in room temperature or in hot and colder area, new to determine the mass, and how much of each sample should we place into the single container.
2124	1	0	They didn't come up with conclusions, they problem, thesis
2125	1	2	The additional information from the procedure is what the samples are. It tells you in the table but you wouldn't be given that along with the procedure. Secondly you need to know what containers you should be using. Lastly you will need to know what the materials are and also how to determine the mass of each sample.
2126	1	2	In the groups procedure instead of just saying a container say what kind and it's size. The procedure needs to include what you see to weigh the samples. The procedure needs to be more specific with the samples. I would need to know if I had to treat each sample differently.
2127	1	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to put into the different samples. I would also need to know in what kind of container because the material can effect the outcome and whether to leave the containers in room temperature or in the heat.
2128	1	1	After reading the groups procedure the information that I would add would be to determine how much material I would add to one cup. I would also need to know how much distilled water is needed in the cup. After doing that I would also need know how much vinegar is allowed in the cup.
2129	1	1	To replicate the experiment  i  would  need to know how much vinegar I need to put into the containers. I would need to know how to measure the mass in.
2130	1	1	You would need to know that you have to mass it before you do anything and you have to mass it after the whole expirement. You need to know how much vinegar to pour on the samples.
2131	1	1	The group should specify what are the four different samples. More information is needed on what should be done to the samples during the 24 hours. Also we need to know what kind of instrurrent is used to measure the sample.
2132	1	1	One thing that you would need to know is how much vinegar your using. Another thing would be how your going to weigh these materials, lastly you would need to know exactly what your looking for in these materials,  such as if they  dissolved or grew.
2133	1	1	In order to demonstrate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each cup. You also would need to know how to determine the mass which would go in the first step of the procedure. The samples also should be rinsed with the same amount of water, which should also be in the procedure.
2134	1	2	The additional information that needs to be added to the procedure is what are they measuring everything in. Also, we would need to know what size containers they used small, medium, or large. Plus where are they removing the samples from. We would need to know that before we even start the lab. Last, how are we going to find the mass by a triple beam balance. The procedure needs more information or we can't even start the lab.
2135	1	0	Additional information you would need would be why they are doing this experiment (purpose statement), more trials of the experiment and a control.
2136	1	3	First you would have to say what the samples have to be , you also have to say how much vinegar to pour in the containers, and how big the containers should be.
2137	1	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. Where are we going to put the containers so they get the same amount of heat/sunlight. How long should you rinse it for.
2138	1	0	I would need all four samples: Ad the old results, and vingar. Also water and containers.
2139	1	2	You would need to know how much of the sample was used. Also, you would need to know how much vinegar was used and lastly, you would need to know how big the conde is used and put the samples into.
2140	1	2	The additional information I would need to replicate, this experiment is the mass of the cup used. If I were to measure the material in a cup. The cup also has a mass so you will have to substance that one. Also, you would need to know the actual names of the sample being used. The procedure does not include that information and that is vital to hav.The other thing that I would to know is how much vinegar to the top of the container specified just a little bit.
2141	1	3	Some additional information I would need to replicate this experiment, is first off how mach vinegar to pour in each container using to much or to little vinegar can skew the results. Secondly, I would need to know in what condition I should plac the container in. It is possible heat and light may alter the results. Finally, I would need to know if the containers should be covered or not. The samples being exposed to oxygen can also alter the results.
2142	1	1	(1)If Put not show wait so lable ^p (2) How long we ^p (3)Expt more about the
2143	1	2	In order to repeat this experiment on my own, the group of students should have first off, talked about what the four samples they were testing were. Also they should have told us the amount vinegar that was needed to be used in each sample. And lastly, they should have explained in their procedure to calculate the difference in their starting mass, and ending mass.
2144	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I will need to know more information such as how much vinigar in each of four seprate containers and how long the experiment is, pecific mersurements will help also.
2145	1	3	In step one, I would need to know what the four samples were that I was determining mass of. In step two, I would need to how much vinegar to pour into the containers. I would need to know what temperature to place the samples at in step 4.
2146	1	0	You'd need a stop wacth, you'd need to be there at the exact time,leave the mass
2147	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, one piece of additional information that would need to be included to replicate their experiment would be including the names of the four different samples that are being tested. Another piece of information should be that, in steps 1 and 6, that you make sure to record each separate mass and not just determine them. A final piece of information should be how much vinegar to pour in.
2148	1	2	The additional information needed in this experiment is minimum of three. Such as in number in number two, they should tell you how much vinegar should be added in the four separate containers. Also when they say to put the sample material in the container they should say if there is a size limit. Most of all, to find out the mass, you need to show what unit they measured in so you can get the correct or some data as them.
2149	1	0	In order to replicate this expierement I would need to have all the materials that are found in this procedure. I would then gather all of my materials and follow the procedure and also record my data down on a piece of paper. In expierements I always like to bring a watch for timing the samples just in case there are none around.
2150	1	2	After reading the group's procedure I would need more specific information to replicate the experiment. First, the procedure says to pour vinegar in each container, but it does not specify how much should be used. Also, the procedure doesn't say what size container I would use for each of the containers used in the experiment. Last, the procedure doesn't say where I should pour the residue after the rinse.
2151	1	2	After reading the group's procedure, I then figured out how they could replicate it. They could change the amount of vinegar they put in each sample. Also, they can record the room temperature to see if it changes within the 24 hours. Finally, they can change the type of water that they use in step 4 to make a difference.
2152	1	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need the mass of the containers, a description of the container, and a control in order to maximize the accuracy of the data.
2153	1	0	To replicate the experement, I would need to know the problem of the experiment. What the mass of the sample has to do with the experiment and what the marble, limestone, wood, and plastic are for.
2154	1	2	In order to replicate the groups procedure, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they used. They would need a control group and the amount of distilled water used to rinse the materials. They also need amount of time in distilled water, more trials could be done for accuracy.
2155	1	3	First, the procedure needs is specific which materials are being used as sample. In the procedure, there was and mention of the samples being marbles of any kind. Also, the procedure doesn't a tempt to control the amount of vinegar in each container. This is necessary to replicate the experiment as different volumes of vineea eased after the estume. The procedure, finally needs to keep the size of the marbles constant. Surface area may be a factor in the experiment.
2156	1	3	After reading the group procedure, some additional information that should be added is to list what numbers steps that you have to repeat because it a little confusing on what steps to repeat. Another one is to list out the materials, it has no information on what materials are being used only in the data table which was done after the experiment. Next thing they should add is the amount of vinegar,water etc that is need for the experiment for all trials and lastly they should be specific about where to put  thing for example where do you put the materiasl often washing them off.
2157	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, 4 things that would need to be added are that they would need to identify the four different samples, they would need to tell you the amount of vinegar to put in each cup, they would need a control and lastly they would need to do multiple trials in order for it to be a valid experiment.
2158	1	3	To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It doesn't tellyou how much vinegar you need. Also, I would need to know the size of the samples. Should they all be the same size or different? It doesn't tell you what size the samples should be. The last piece of information I would need is what the samples even are. The procedure doesn't tell you which materials to even use.
2159	1	3	I would need to know what kind of container the sample were put in,and the amount of vinegar poured on the samples, also the kind of vinegar.
2160	1	2	In the groups procedure they do not include some details that are crucial for the experiment to be repeated. First you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You would also need to know how much of each sample was put into each tube. You would also need to know if the experiment was repeated to see that there was no errors accidentally ,happened and you would need the name of the sample that you are useing.
2161	1	1	One thing that they don't say that you need to replicate the experiment would be, how much of the samples to use. The procedure dosn't say that you need to find the difference in the masses.
2162	1	3	In order to repeat this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they poured into the container for each sample. I would also need to know what kind of marble, wood and plastic they used since there isn't one kind of each. It would be useful to know what containers were used and hou long they rinsed the samples for.
2163	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what to use to determine the mass of the 4 different samples, since it does not state that in the procedure. Also, the samples of the items should be added in because you have no idea what you are testing, if they are not in the procedure. Also, there should be a given amount of vinegar in the procedure, not a vague description. Not having the same amount of vinegar in all 4 containers could affect the experiment.
2164	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. Also i would need to know how long to rinse the rocks with distilled water.  Without those pieces of information, i could not precesily replicate the experiment.
2165	1	1	Another piece of information you might need, is how much distilled water is used. Also if you are using. the same amount of each sample. Even maybe, how much vinegar you are using on each sample.
2166	1	1	The additional information you would need to replicate the expirement wald be an accurate mesurement of vinegar being pared into the containers. Also an accurate measurement of the distilled water you would uses for each container to rinse it off, after 24 hours.
2167	1	2	For this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I need in each cup.  I also do not know what the four different materials/samples are, so it would be nice to have some ideas. They should also put down to try this two or three times all together  so we have more than one of the tables to read.
2168	1	2	"There are three pieces of additional information that could be reach to replicate the experiment. In steps 1 and 6 they say that they determine the mass of the samples. We must know how they do the or what ri they use. Also in steps 2 they say ""pour vinegar"". We must know how much vinegar to put into each container. Lastly, in step 4, they say to ""rinse each sample"". We must know for how long or what methods were used to accomplich this."
2169	1	2	To replicate this experiment you would need a specific amount a vinagar, you would also need to know what the 4 samples were. you also need to have water in the containers containing the vinagar.
2170	1	1	What information I would need would pcobbaly be marble, limestone and wood.
2171	1	2	The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you are supposed to put in each of the four containers. Another information that you will need is what's the sizes of each of the four containers because when you put the vinegar, it has to be on equal amounts and if you don't know the sizes of the containers it will affect the experiment.
2172	1	2	In this experiment, the procedure did not tell us what the four materials were. They never told us how big the containers should be. And after pouring vinegar into the containers why would you get another container to put them in? It was very confusing.
2173	1	0	First you would need to gather your materials. Then because safety is first, make sure you are ready with goggles and gloves. After you organize yourself, you then determine the mass of four different samples and so on. After the experiment you complete your data with the following information and a graph/chart.
2174	1	3	The students needed to explain what samples they were using in the procedure, they needed to say how much vinegar to use and what type of vinigar to use.
2175	1	1	You would need to know how much vinegar to put in the cup, how much sample for each cup and how much distilled water to use to rinse with. You must know all these measurements or the experiment could be wrong. The data could be wrong which would the make your lab report & conclusion wrong.
2176	1	3	What kind of containers are needed? What are the four different samples ? How much vinegar do you put in to each container?
2177	1	0	I would pour the vinegar in non-identical container so you could know which is which. You could measure how much you put in to the cup or containers. They could have done the trial more than once to make it was correct.
2178	1	0	Marble limestone and plastic all absent in the negetives in differences.
2179	1	1	In order to replicate that experiment you need to say what 4 different samples you are using. You also need to say how you are going to label the cups. In measuring the 4 different samples you need to say how to mease. You lastly need to mention the materials you need to use for that procedure.
2180	1	2	To make this procedure complete, there should be specification about how big the containers are, there should also be specification about how much vinegar you pour in these containers. Lastly, saying how you determine the mass of each sample hey.
2181	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to add what the four examples are in the procedures, that way, the experiment know what they're working with. You would also include a control, and independent/dependant variables, also, take observations.
2182	1	2	You will need to know exactly what materials are needed. You must also know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Also the starting weight of each.
2183	1	2	1.What shape the samples were ^p 2.What type of vinegar was used ^p 3.What type of marble, limestone, wood and plastic was used
2184	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar is being put into each cup. The specific types of plastic, wood, limestone and marble and how long the samples were rinsed for.
2185	1	2	In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need to know need to knew how big each container was the holds the samples.I would need to know much vinegar to put in each container. Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the 3 objects.
2186	1	1	I would need to know the materials that are going to get measured. The amount of time that each material stayed in the vinegar. The staring mass and the ending mass of each material.
2187	1	1	The information needed would be what is trying to be proven with this investigation. Also, they would need to state what the original samples are & thickness of each original sample.
2188	1	0	I will need a balance to weight the mass of four different samples.Replace vinegar for lemon and put in each four edentically.After 24 hours, i will use water to rinse each sample. After i will use the balance to check if there is any change in the mass of each.
2189	1	0	Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is that I would need to know what measuring tool to use in order to weigh the samples (triple-beam balance). I would also need to determine the difference in the mass of the samples. The group showed the difference on their data table, but didn't list that step in their procedure. Lastly, I would need to record every different mass on the data table which also isn't a step in the group's procedure.
2190	1	2	In addition to the procedure in acid rain experiment, they forgot to state their hypothesis but in the beginning they also forgot to state their materials such as marble, limestone, wood & plastic in their procedure or how much vinegar in each solution.
2191	1	0	What the procedure is asking is for them to find away how to make acid rain. Yo will need containers to hold the rain, then your will need to label the containers. After 24 hours they will be ready to then find out the mass.
2192	1	1	The additional information I will need in order to replicate the experiment is the procedures, so I know what Im doing. The samples, so I know what Im working on. Then starting mass.
2193	1	3	One thing someone would need is which materials they are testing, if the procedure doesn't include marble, limestone etc, then it can't be replicated. The procedure should also include  how much vinegar to put into each container because of this faster mass not controlled the experiment won't be valid. Finally, the students need to add where to keep the containers because different environments can affect the results they get for each.
2194	1	0	I would need there 1.prediction to what they were really questioning. I would probably say the date and time also, including there conclusion.
2195	1	0	They did not look up data about acid bain and they need t.
2196	1	2	"In order to replicate this experiment, first of all the ""samples"" would need to be identified as ""samples of ..."". They should start out at roughly the same mass as well. The amount of vinegar should have been constant for each container. How were the containers labeled, numerically, or by name?"
2197	1	3	The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the samples and container sizes. Also you need lables to identify each sonified container. The same amount andend of vinegar and water. Finally, the same amount of time. And creat a lable the somewhere
2198	1	3	Some additional information I would need to complete the experiment would be to know what the samples are in the procedure, also I would need to know how big the containers need to be and how much vinegar to pour in. Also I would need to know what temperature the samples need to be at, also if they are covered or uncovered. Then I would need to run a control of water on the samples and run the experiment multiple times.
2199	1	2	In order for me to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinigar to pour in with the stones.Another thing i would need to know is what are the four materials.No where in the procedure is there names of stones.Another would be how much of the sample to use in grams.Nowhere in the procedure is there an indication of the mass.
2200	1	2	They will need to include how much vinegar to put into the containers. They also need to make sure that the samples have the same orrigional mass. I will also need to know what the control is and how many times re repeat the experiment for valitity. Also, how long should we nase  the samples for.
2201	1	2	To do this experiment, you need to know how much sample to put in a cup, the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the cup with the sample in it, and how many trials to do the experiment.
2202	1	1	For me too replicate this experiment the additional information I would need is were did they sit the container did it sit in the room , freezer were.They all so could of told use if they used move traits or not.
2203	1	0	This procedure can be improved. You must keep everything constant, including the amount of starting mass which was not done in this experiment. Multiple trials would prevent many errors from being recorded because there would be materials to keep the numbers in the appropriate range. A control should also be added such as not pouring anything on one of each sample. The corrections will make the lab much more accurate.
2204	1	0	You will need marble, limestone, wood because they the variable pieces in this experiment. You will need to experiment with all of there.
2205	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know what size the containers need to be. Also  you need to know what are the containers bowls, plates, cups and you would also need to know to determine the mass of each sample.
2206	1	0	I would like to have known why were they doing this experiment? And why didn't or the samples get compare with warer by the vinegar?
2207	1	0	Well first a problem statement would be helpful knowing there independent and dependent variable also knowing their controle group would have helped.
2208	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment, i need to know how much vinegar to put into 4 seprate containers. I need to know what material to use, so without the information that i listed i would not be able to do this experiment 30 minutes it was done the first time. With the information that they left of was in there then i would be able to replicate this experiment.
2209	1	3	I would need to know how much vinegar is to be put in each container. I would also need to know how long I had to rinse each item. I also need to know what the samples were dried on.
2210	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment the procedure would have to say which samples to use. It actually only says place a sample of one material into a container, I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The procedure only says pour vinegar in each of four seperate, but identical containers. For this step I would need to know what size of containers I should use for the experiment. I would also have to measure each sample before and after doing, the lab so I would add that to my procedure.
2211	1	2	Additional information I com to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in the containers. How many rocks should be placed in the container, and how large the containers should be. This additional information would help me to replicate the acid rain experiment.
2212	1	1	The group would need to tell me what type of container to use. Am I using a bucket, a beaker or what? Do I put all the materials in separate containers at the same time, or do I wait until the first one is finished to start the second one. What am I removing the samples with. My hands, tongs, what? This is the additional info needed to replicate this experiment.
2213	1	2	I will need to no what are the names of the four different samples I'm determarning the mass. I will also need to no what units am I measuring by but last but not least, I will need to no how big is the container is.
2214	1	0	What could be added to this groups procedure is they could perform more trials so that they could get more results. They also could find a control so that they could compare all of their answers to now the control was affected and they also could move vinegar the four different samples right after they took them out of the vinegar because the water could have had as affect an their accurate.
2215	1	1	Further information would include, why or what purpose the students were conducting the expirement, what size the samples were and explain why each sample is a different mass. ^p The purpose was to record and compare the mass of each sample.
2216	1	0	In order to replicate this experiment you would need is to know how many containers we would need.
2217	1	1	To replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because it doesn't give a specific amount. We would also need to know how much water we need to rinse the samples off with after the 24 hours. Also, we need to know what we are determining the mass with, because the procedure just says find the mass.
2218	1	2	One thing you should need to know would be to know what type of sample you would need to set. If you don't know what sample to use, then the experiment is useless. Also you should know how much of the vinegar to put into each of the containers. And finally, you should know what to weigh your sample on and if you should set the weigher to 0 before weighing it in. You need to know what to weigh it on before there are many different weighing systems for biology and if you don't know which are to use, then your lab might cam out wrong.
2219	1	2	First of all, we would need to to knew what the four different sample are. This way we can talk about it in our data and conclusion. Also, we meed to know how much vinegar to pour into each container because that is a controlled variable. Lastly, it never says to messure infroms so we do not know how much of the material we should be measuring
2220	1	3	Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, would be the amount of vinergar to place with the samples. Also, I need to know if there were certain temperature the samples needed to be placed in. The last thing I need to know is what type of containers to put the samples in. You don't know if the vinegar is going to affect the containers.
2221	1	2	In order for me to replicate the experiment, I would need to know where the containers were kept for 24 hours. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the four separate containers. Last but not least, I would need to know how much of plastic, wood, limestone and marbles to put into the containers of vinegar to repeat this experiment.
2222	1	3	One piece of information that would be needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinigar was added to the containers. Another piece of information needed is, what kind of containers were used in the investigation. Finally, the last poice of information needed to replicate the investigation is, how long would the samples be rinsed with distilled water, also how much water was used to rinse.
2223	1	0	You place the sample of one material container into one container and label repeat the sample iinto a single container. After 24 hours,remove the dry sample and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the sample to sit and dry for 30 min.
2224	1	2	You would need to know the size of the containers. What brand of vinigar was used, so that there can be no change in data. Last you would need to know what it was weighed on.
2225	1	2	In order some to replicate I need to know how big each container was. How much vinegar was poured on the the subjects. Also I would need each of the subjects to have the same mass. Show it would be more correct it it was all the same size.
2226	1	0	If I wanted to make the same kind of experiment, I would pour vinegar in each of the 4 separate but identical containers. Then I would wait 24 hours then rinse each sample with distilled water. Finally, allow all the samples to sit and dry for 30 min.
2227	1	1	In orderto replicate the experiment i  would need to know the 4 different samples used stated in the procedure. I would also need to know what and why we are performing the experiment. In other words, the purpose and problem. I would also need to have stated in the procedure to calculate the difference in mass.
2228	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, the procedure would need to be rewritten with more detail. First, a step to record the mass of 4 samples before placing them in vinegar would need to be added. Next, the procedure does not specify how much vinegar should be in each container. Another step they did not add was to re-label the samples after they are removed from vinegar, in order to tell them a part from each other.
2229	1	1	After reading the groups procedure i would conclude that i will add a independent variable to the lab. Also i would want to place the containers in a constant temperature area for more accurate testing.
4066	2	2	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B has the largest amount stretched. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental decison is by allowing the weights to hang longer to see if the plastic would stretch more. Another way he could have improved his experiment is by doing a third trials to really be sure that his results are correct.
4067	2	3	A. Sample B plastic has the most stretchability. B. One way it to add the original length of the plastic to the chart so you can find the difference of the original and after it stretched. Another way is to show the weight of the weights being put on.
4068	2	2	The stretchiest plastic was plastic B in both trials. And the least stretchiest plastic was plastic A in both trials. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by adding a control and using the same length of each plastic.
4069	2	1	a. Conclusion: type a plastic stretched the most. ^p b. The student have used the same length of plastic for every type and should have did more than one trial.
4070	2	1	a) Plastic type A and B stretched after being pulled apart for five minutes. Plastic type C and D either shrank in length or stayed the same.^p b) The student should of added a control by hanging the plastics with no weight. Also the student should specify how much weight is on the clamp.
4071	2	1	A.) Based on the data of the table, I conclude that plastic B was the most stretchable. In both trials it proved to be always above 20mm. ^P B.) The student could've used different clamps in his trials, this would've expanded the student possibilities with the plastics. To help with the validity, the student could explain what he did different. For trial T2, for the measures are not the same as T1 except for plastic type D, in both trials the measures were the same.
4072	2	2	The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic B was the strongest. Plastic B was the strongest because in trial one it stretched the most to 22mm. Ther trial two B stretched to 23mm. To improve the experiment design the student could state a length they want the sample plastic to be. In the procedure the student should have stated labels that she/he was measuring in.
4073	2	3	A conclusion that can be dawn from the students experiment is that plastic B is able to stretch the farthest (T1:22mm, T2:23mm) and plastic A stretched the least (T1:10mm, T2:12mm). The validity of this experiment could have been improved greatly by doing these two things; 1) Making sure that the starting length of the plastics were all the same and 2)determining how much of the plastic will be stretched to the table at the beginning. By doing these two things, you're ensuring controlled variables therefore validating your experiment
4074	2	1	B. Two ways the students could improve the experiment is to doing it again and again until you get the same results. Another way could to leave the plastics hanging for longer.
4075	2	3	I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable because according to the data plastic B in trial 1 stretched 22mm and trial 2 23mm unlike plastic type A which in T1 stretched 0mm and in trial 2 2mm. One way the students could have improved their experiment would be of saying exactly how much weights to add and keep it the same for all the plastics. Another way they could have improved this experiment would be by having the same length of plastic for all the plastics, also they could have done more trials to improve their experiment.
4076	2	2	a. Based on the data, the strectchiest polymer plastic of the four is plastic type B, because in the both trials, it stretched the most (22 and 23 mm). ^p b. 1.) Add more trials to increase accuracy of the results. 2.) Repeat the experiment with heavier weights to see if it affects the results.
4077	2	1	a) The only type of plastic that appears to make no change with the 2 trials is plastic type D. ^p b) They could have improved their design/validity by telling us exactly how much they measured in procedure 1. Another would be they could do a 3rd trial.
4078	2	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable of all the plastic types. Type D was a close second. Plastic type A and C are not very stretchy. ^p b. To improve the validity of the experiment the student could have done 2 things, give the length of the plastics they used and give the amount/type of weights to weigh  the plastic down with the information, the experiment can be duplicated to get similar results.
4079	2	1	Thus for our experimentation our data has proved in conclusion that plastic type B and D recivied similiar results as also high strechibility on their first trial. One way the students could have improved the data is by putting the tike in the data chart. Another way being how students could have improved their data is by telling the amount of weights added for stretching.
4080	2	2	a. Plastic Type B stretched the farthest in both trials. Type D stretched second farthest in each trial and C and A stretched the third and least farthest respectively. The order of each plastic type's stretchiness remained the same in both trials. ^p b. The student could have done more trials. They also could've used more specific types.
4081	2	0	In conclusion this is what the plastic did in the first try and this is what happened in the second try. The best plastic is plastic B because it hangs longer than the other. ^p To make it better is hang it for 7 minutes. maybe put something else than weight, I think scissors.
4082	2	1	a) Plastic D is the best type of plastic because it's the most stretchable unlike type A which is the least stretchable.^p b.) Do another trial and add heavier weights.
4083	2	1	Trial 2 was the most stretched plastic because after stretching them a couple of times then they set loose and stretchier than the first time. The most stretchiest was plastic B it has the most stretch than the others. ^p The student could've kept it hanging maybe a little bit longer.
4084	2	0	3. Based on the data, plastic D held the most weight. Plastic A held the least. Plastic C went down the second time, so maybe it wasnt sturdy enough. Two ways they could improve their experiment is to use different sized plastics. Instead of putting it attached to the table, it could be stretched over a cup. By doing this it will hold more weight, and they will get more acurate answers.
4085	2	2	A) When dealing with different types of plastic to find out their strechability, I found that plastic type A that 1 had the least amount of stretchability, with only 10mm, whereas plastic type B, trial two out measured A, C, and D's stretchability with 25mm!^p B) 1. He could've specified the names of the plastics, 2. He could've specified the weights added and made sure they're the same.
4086	2	1	A.D was the most and stayed the same tril 1 and tril 2.^p (B)He should of done another tril to make sure if he got different/ same results.
4087	2	2	Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most, plastic type A did the least amount of stretching. ^p They could have used more trials. They also could have added on more weight over a period of time.
4088	2	0	There is only two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is by telling the day or hour of the experiment, and see if the student's hypothesis was correct or not.
4089	2	0	The students that could of have improved the experimental design and or validity of the results its make sure all their supplies are there put the data table in order, and follow the time as instructed.
4090	2	2	(A) Plastic type B was the superior in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p (B) Record the weight that was put on to show how much effected each plastic. Also conducting more trials and making a larger graph to show the growth and change of each plastic.
4091	2	2	The plastic streatures more or less depending on the type could have reapeated it again to see what would happen used types of plastic.
4092	2	1	Based on the student data all different types of plastic was stretch more than others. Plastic B stretch the farthest, plastic A stretched the lowest. You can conclude that plastic B was the better plastic for the polymer investigation. ^p 1 Way) student could have changed or tested the different plastics at different times. (way 2) Remove the weight from 2 plastics and leave the other 2 with to see the outcome difference.
4093	2	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest making it the weakest type of plastic. However, plastic type A stretched the least, making it the stordest. b) 1.The student should have had atleast one more trial for completely accurate results. 2. The student should have more specific by giving units to measure length in and specific types of plastic.
4094	2	3	A conclusion that I can draw from this data is that plastic type B, stretched the most on both trials (22, 23mm). Two things that could be improved in this experiment are that a third or more trials could be performed, and also the amount of weight put on should be monitored, and controlled.
4095	2	2	a) Polymer plastic type B has the highest stretchability. It had 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. None of the other types of plastics stretched further than 20mm on either trial. ^p b) The student could have tested more types of plastic or made more trials to improve the experiment.
4096	2	1	I concluded that plastics A and B strech the most. One way the students could have improved the design is by stating how much weight they were adding. Another way is if they recorded a control for validity.
4097	2	2	"A. Based on the data plastic D isn't very stretchy because it was the same length in both trials. It didn't vary by even an inch. Plastic B must be stretchy because it stretched the largest in both trials. B. They could have included more trials they could have at in included the original length of the plastics (before being stretched) so you could compare ""see how much each one stretched."
4098	2	1	3. a) Plastic type A stretched the most C. b) They could of had more trials and used more types of plastic.
4099	2	1	For the conclusion it wasn't a big difference from the (T1) and (T2). It was more like 1 or 2 amount stretched from the first trial we did the procedure 2 times and have got different things most of the time.^p They could have had an empty plastic cup hanging from the plastic type to see it there was much difference. The could have also don a third trial just to see if there was much difference.
4100	2	3	The group can conclude that plastic type B, is the most effective type of plastic. According to the table, Plastic type B held 22mm in trial 1, and 23mm in trial 2. That was the best closely followed by the type D with 20mm, and 20mm. In the experiment, the group could have done 1 more trial to really reinforce the results. Along with that being said, the group also should have measured the weight of the weights, and kept the weight constant for more valid results.
4101	2	2	A) Our expirament was successful. Some of the plastic that we stretched out increase during trial 2. ^p B) They could have told us how long or wide the plastic has to be and how to rap if to the table.
4102	2	1	Based on the student's test, plastic type B is the best. Plastic type B has the highest stretchability in both test. The students could've improved their expirements by adding weights till the plastic broke & performing a different test in trail 2.
4103	2	2	a) I can conclude based on the students data, that plastic type B was the most stretchable. And plastic type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was be, first of all, describing what kind of tape was used because simple, weakest tape would probably, not work in this situation. The best kind of tape might be duct tape, scratch tape, or measuring tape. So that needs to be specified. Also, the student should have told us the exact amount of weight that should be used for each plastic if different amounts were placed measurements would be different and all inclusive. The design needs to be more specific.
4104	2	1	The plastic type A, B increases except plastic C & D. Plastic A increase from 10 mm to 12mm, plastic B increases from 22mm to 23 mm, plastic D stayed the same 20mm, 20mm, plastic  C decrease from 14 mm to 13 mm. ^p One way to improve this experiment is to allow them to hang for more time , Another way is to run more than two trials.
4105	2	2	A) Based on the conclusion of the students data they took 4 pieces of plastic taped them to an edge of adesk, claped wieghts to them and let them hang for 5 minutes. Then measured them to see how long they have stretched. They did this twice for all four types of plastics. So they got two results for all of the plastics. B) Two ways the students could of improved their experimental design are one had at, the same amount of weight on the different types of plastics. Also they could of had more trials so they could of had more results.
4106	2	0	a) A conclusion i can make base on this data is that all the specific plastic types had very different effects by either growing, shrinking, or staying the same.^p (b)Two ways the student could have proved the experiment is to include where exactly this experiment is taking place and also the durability of the table being used.
4107	2	1	I conclude that plastic type A has the most stretchability because from T1 to T2 it stretched two more mm and the rest did not stretch as much as type A. One way this student could have improved the experiment design is by ofsonbing how much the clamp at the bottom of the plastic sample should weigh. Another improvent needs to be in step 5. The student needs to specify what kind of weights are needed and how heavy.
4108	2	0	The different plastic type stretched different A. plastic A in the T1 they stretched less the the T2 in the plastic B in the trial 2 they stretched one mm that the trial C the trial, they stretched more than the trial 2. D they are equal.^p B. The two ways the student could have improved to the experimental design or validity of the results is add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes the other is and then measure the length of the plastic types.
4109	2	2	The student could have impoved this by being more specific for example the could say how long the piece of plastic is how much weight is being added to the plastic and to also shoe the type being used.
4110	2	0	Based on the data i can see that not all of the types of plastic stretched, one type of plastic got smaller and one type stood the same. One way that the student could have improved the experiment is by explaining what the four types of plastic were. And second they could have drawn a graph to show the difference of the plastic before and after.
4111	2	3	Based on the data one can conclude that plastic type B has the highest stretchability because its average amount stretched is greater than any other types. ^P Two ways that the student could've improved the validity of the results would be to cut all out polymers to the same length and to add the same amount of weight to every polymer.
4112	2	1	"The polymer plastic type A & B were stretch 2mm more after trial 2. Plastic type C & D  obviously is a totally different type of polymer plastic which is not easy to stretch. Plastic type ""C"" decrease 1 mm while plastic type ""D"" stayed the same. They could of improved there validity by mentioning how many weights they used for each trial & also stating the different type of polymer plastics."
4113	2	3	A) Plastic B has stretched out the furthest more than any other plastic I have tested. The least stretched plastic is plastic type A which was at 10 for T1 and 12 for T2. Type B stretched to 22 in T1 and 23 in T2 at the most stretchability. Type C was at 14 for T1 and 13 for T2. Lastly, type D was at type 20mm for T1 and T2 at 20. The students improved by starting to find out which polymer had the most stretchability. B) One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add a control with all polymers plastic with stretching it out. Another to improve is to add more for starts such as same starting length of all plastics, same weight, same surface area.
4114	2	3	Based on the data plastic B stretched the most out of all the plastics. So plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic out of the four plastics. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it only stretche10-12mm and plastic B stretched 22-23mm. The students should have stated how much weight was more used and if they used the same amount of weights for each plastic. Also the plastics should all start out the same length to ensure validity.
4115	2	3	a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength because it stretched the farthest in both trials, and plastic type A has the least tensile strength, because it stretched the least in both trials. ^p b) The students could have indicated how many millimeters of plastic should be taped on top of the table, and indicated how heavy each weight should be.
4116	2	2	The conclution would be that plastic type D has streched the most and that plastic type A had streched the least. One way the student could have improved the experement would be to tell people the mass of the weights used. Another thing the student could have done was to list the starting length of the plastic in his data table.
4117	2	1	"A conclusion based on the students data is ""B"" and ""D"" were measured out to be in the low both. ""A"" and ""C"" were measured in the laend. One way they could of improved the design is meseric the length of tin plastic before they added weight B. A second way they could improve this design is tell us in the procedure when to measure after adding the weights on."
4118	2	3	In the polymer investigation four different polymer plastics were tested for their stretchability. In this experiment, plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type A stretched the least. The results are reliable because of the two trials the amount stretched only different by 2 mm or the most, disrupting our consistency in the experiment. To improve this experiment, I would run a third and fourth trial to develop an average amount stretched for each plastic type. Additionally, I would make the length of each plastic type the same for a better comparison of each plastics amount stretched.
4119	2	2	"My conclusion would be that plastic A would be the most resistant plastic and plastic plastic B would be the stretchiest plastic . One way the student could have improved the validity of the results could have been to run more trials for the samples of plastic. One way to improve the experimentol design would be to change step 6"" to repeat steps 1-5 for the remaining three plastic samples'', this would couse less confusion for people doing this procedure."
4120	2	2	A) Based on the student data I conclude that plastic type B was the stretchiest of all plastics because in both trial 1 and 2 it got higher than 20 both times which was higher for any other plastic. ^P B) The student could have improved this experiment by having a constant amount of weight as put on all the plastics and he should have had a control group.
4121	2	2	The experiment shows that plastic type B has the most tensile strength, since it would have done to improve the experiment are to specify the amount of weight  added and give specific starting length for each plastic, perfeably the same length for each.
4122	2	3	Freom this experiment we can conclude that plastic type B stretched the farthest when weights were added to the pull of gravity. They could improve the experiment by saying how many weighs should be added to the plastic to keep it constant. Also they could add more trials to increase the validity.
4123	2	2	A. Based on the results of the experiment, I believe that plastic C will take the most weight. All the other plastics either extended when more weight was added or stayed the same. Plastic C though actually shrunk in size unlike plastic A which went from 10 to 12 and B which went from 22-23 mm and lastly D witch remained at 20 mm the whole duration. ^p B: A way the student could of improved the experiment validity is by having more trials and having the plastic strips the same length.
4124	2	2	I conclude that plastic type B has a stronger materials compared to the other types. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more trials, another way it would have been better is by saying how much weight was being used.
4125	2	2	Plastic type B stretches the most. The students could have said how much heights they put on the plastics. They could of also mentioned the amount of time the weights were on the ruler they could of said now much tape to use.
4126	2	1	Based on the students data, type D's length stayed the same in both trials. Also type B had the highest length, and type A the smallest. This lab could be improved by stating the purpose of the second trial. Also, since there are 2 trials, the lengths should be averaged. There also should have been a percise number of weights added.
4127	2	2	In conclusion it seems that the plastic type B's outcome of amount stretched in mm was the highest against the other three.^p State what length you're excepting to keep them the same.^p Also for better results the students should have done a third trial to be on the safe side.
4128	2	0	a) T2 the amount that was stretched in was more than the amount in T1. ^p b) The student could have estimated 2.
4129	2	0	A= As the students where doing the right thing but they could have done it in more detail so we can now a little more. ^p B=The could have improved it by writing how many times they did it and record how long they did it for.
4130	2	1	"In conclusion plastic type B proved to be the most strechable (after 5 mins)  reaching ti 22 $ 23 mm stretched. Howevwr plastic type A proved to be the least stretchable after 5 mins reaching 10 mm in trial and 17 mm in trial 2. Plastic type B proved to be the second least strechable and 20 mm at both trials  and type C proved to be the second least strechable. After five minutes in trial 1 it was 14mm long and in trial two it was 13 mm long, ""A"" was the least stretchable while ""B"" was the most stretchable."
4131	2	2	"The data table showed us that plastic type  ""B"" had stretched the most out of all other plastic type materials. This exiperement could have more trails and more in formation of their producerse."
4132	2	2	(a) According to the student's data plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial.^p (b). The student should have specified how much the weights weighed and how many of them to put on the clamp.^p The student should have specified what they were measuring the length of the plastic types with.
4133	2	2	The plastic type did have an effect on the amount stretched. As the plastic stretched from A to D the amount stretched in mm changed from 10 to 20 on the first trail and 12 to 20 on the second trial. I say plastic B stretched the best becaused it stretched the most at 22 and 23 mm the first and second trials. ^P The students expirement was not valid. They could of done more trials. They could of told us what type of plastic they used.
4134	2	2	based on the experiment data, I can conclude that plastic B has the greatest stretchability by stretching 22 & 23 mm. the least stability plastic was A of only 10 & 12mm. ^p The students could have improved the experience by adding independent/ dependent variables, and completed 3 trials all with equal weights.
4135	2	0	The plastics stretched a small amount in most in some stayed the same.^p He could of added more weights.^p Waited more times.
4136	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest, therefore it is the most flexible, stretchable or most likely thinnest of all four plastic types. Type B finished with 22mm in the first trial and 23 in the second trial. The least stretchable plastic type, type A finished with 10mm in the first trial and 12 in the second trial. ^p b) This student should've identified the length which all four plastic samples should be to ensure that each is given a fair trial. Also, the student should classify the size, shape and amount of materials used preferably. Each type of material should be identical in ensure accuracy.
4137	2	0	So  in this lab I recorded four types  of plastic type bags. Also I recorded the amount stretched in the four types of bags. I did two tries each. Two things they could improve is their procedure list their data table. Also their results of the amount stretched.
4138	2	3	a. The students data concludes that plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^p b. The student could have made all the plastics the same starting length and added the same amount of weights each time.
4139	2	3	a) based on the student's data I can conclud that plastic type A stretched the least at 10mm T1 and 10mm on T2. plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm on T1 and 23mm on T2. b) Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design are set a size a weight to put on the clamp.
4140	2	2	a) Based on the student's data. Plastic type D was the one that stretched the most making it the most durable. For example, plastic A only stretched 10mm, while D stretched to 20mm. Also, the second trial was important because for plastic A.C, different amounts of length was recorded.^p b) One way to improve the experiment design is to tell how many weights are added to the clamps and how heavy they are. The students can then use these weights to test another trial which would make the design better. Because plastic D stretched the same amount in both trials, it'll be best to create a third trial for each plastic.
4141	2	2	The conclusion that was made is that plastic type B stretched more in both trials compared to the othes 3 plastic types because plastic Type got 22 and 23 mm for both trials while the next best plastic type got 20mm for both trials. The student must include in the procedure the amount of weight to add for step 4. Also they should explain more for instance like what does the clamp do?
4142	2	2	Based on the data I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most out of any of the other plastics.^p Two ways that the student could have improved the design and /or validity of the results are by telling us what types of plastics). Second the student should have added a third part to the table, how much weight was being applied.
4143	2	3	The plastic type (B) stretched out the more in both trials than the other types of plastic.^p One way they could improve their experiment was to tell us how much weight they used on the clamps.^p Another one is they could have written down the length of plastic before they started to see the difference.
4144	2	1	There  wasn't much of a difference between (T1) and (T2). It only stretched like 2mm at most and sometimes is even just stayed the same. One way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 1 more trial. Another way the student could have improved the experiment is by using several other materials not just plastic.
4145	2	3	Based on the students data you can conclude that Plastic B stretched the farthest and Plastic A stretched the least. Two ways this student could have improved this experiment is by providing the start length of each plastic before the weights are added. Another thing they could do to improve this experiment is to include the weight that was added to the clamp for each plastic.
4146	2	1	a. Based on the student's data, plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p b. First, the students should have mentioned what type of plastic to use to replicate the experiment, and it seems they used the same pieces of plastic for each type on both trials, which could cause inaccuracies because the first trial may have stretched the plastic out too much for the second trial.
4147	2	0	Based on the students data, my conclusion would be that T2 got more results than T1. Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design by giving more results, and measurements.
4148	2	3	a) Based on the data, the polymer plastic B is at the top of the list of stretchability at about 22.5 mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the validity of the trial could be to add one or two more trials. Also, he could have measured the spot were he put the type so thart each one started at the same spot.
4149	2	3	Plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. However, type A is the strongest of all of the plastics because it stretched the least and was able to support the weights. ^p The student could have specified how much weight to add to each plastic to keep the trials constant. They also should have specified which samples they were using and the size of each sample to maintain consistency throughout trials. Both of these would help improve the validity of the data.
4150	2	1	The conclusion of this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the most with 23 (mm) with trial. ^p 2. A way to improve this experiment is clarify what the plastics is tested for and if it needs to be stretchy or not stretchy. Also to use different amounts of weights to see what the main stretch is. Also a control in this experiment to compare to could help.
4151	2	1	Based on the students data you can conclude that for the most part all four types of plastic had almost the same length at mm stretched to the two trials. ^p Two ways the student can improve the experiment is that they could say what the starting length for each plastic type would be or they could increase the amount of time the plastic hangs from the table by.
4152	2	1	Well based on the student data plastic type B was the plastic that stretched the most on both trys. One way that student could the valdity of her expirment would to have a control. This way you have somthing to test the other results against.
4153	2	1	Based on the conclusion plastic type B resulted in the most stretched T1-22, T2-23. concluding that 1/4 it was the most strongest.The students should have added a specific amount of weight to the clamps as the same and concluding the results on the plastic type lastly the student should have performed the second trial with different measurement.
4154	2	1	Plastic type B was the most stretchable and A was the least. Want longer than 3 min when adding the weights. Add more weights.
4155	2	1	The results seem pretty good. And I think that he could have done more data and more samples.
4156	2	2	From the students data table, one can conclude that plastic type 'B' and 'D' are more elastic  / are able to stretch more than plastic types 'A' and 'C'. The students could have improved their experiment by specifying and controlling the amount of weight added to each clamp and mentionity and maintaining the beginning dimensions of the polymer that subjects  (including thickness.)
4157	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data can be that plastic type D has the most stretchability in both trials.^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results could be: (1) show each of the plastics original length before the trials. (2) If they did a 3rd trial with a longer time of heavier weights.
4158	2	1	"From the graph shown I feel that plastic type ""B"" was more durable than the other plastic because at trial 1 it was the highest mm stretched and some for trial 2. ^P B. Two ways the student could have improved the design is to do more than just 2 trials. They could've also done it in different measurements."
4159	2	3	A. I could conclude from this students experiment that plastic B, was the stretchiest. B. The student could have made their experiment more reliable by specifying the amount of weight and adding a control on even stating how far to put the piece of plastic over the table.
4160	2	3	a) With the results provided, it is shown that plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second, compared to plastic A this is about 11.5mm more stretchy. B) The students should have specified the weights amount that was to be added to the plastic. They should have also said how much of the plastic should be taped to the table, different amounts could affect the amount of weight it could hold.
4161	2	1	In conclusson, plastic type D has the most stretchability. Two ways that students could improve the experiment is by having a control. They could also do more trials to receive a more acuret answer.
4162	2	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials. Therefore, it would most likely break faster than the others. Plastic type A stretched the least amount so, it would probably hold more before breaking. B) The students could have performed more trials. They could've also, use the same amount of weights each trial and for each plastic. It doesn't say how much weight they used, just to add weights.
4163	2	1	a. In conclusion if I take a sample of a type of plastic and measure its length then add weight to it and wait 5 minutes to see how much it is now.^p b. Two ways the student could have improve the experimental design is to add more trials. Another thing they could of did was try is add more thing for the weights.
4164	2	2	The students doing polymer lab can now know plastic type B had stretched the most and plastic type A had stretched the least. The second polymer had the greatest stretchability. Two ways they could have improved the design is taking the plastic over a cylindrical surface thats open and put weights on it to see if that affects it more. Also for better validity of their data they could've put how the plastic measured before and after instead of already skipping to the math part.
4165	2	1	In the data tables there are four different kinds of plastic types and they had to be stretched by weights, within both trials there wasn't really a difference just that plastic type b had the longest trail. They could have told us what type of plastic wrap they used and they should have more trials.
4166	2	2	a)My conclusion is that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all the tested plastics. I came to this conclusion because as you see on the graph on T1 it reached 22 and T2 23 which was higher than all the other plastics tested.^p (b) They could have did more trials because the more they do, the more accurate there result are. Lastly, in the procedure when it says measure they should list the units they wanna use.
4167	2	0	(a)1 Plastic 1 B stretched the most, so it would be best to carry heavier objects. ^p (b)1 Telling what kind of plastics they used were: ^p     2 Be more detailed by how long they stretched it for.
4168	2	3	Overall plastic B stretched the most followed by plastic D, C, then A. This lab needs a lot of work for it to be valid. First the amount of weight needs to be recorded. Also the origional lengths of the 4 plastics need to be on the table because although plastic B is the longest in the end, it may have started at 20mm, but we don't know. Also they should do more trials.
4169	2	2	What I can conclude from the groups results is that polymer B has the least amount of resistance  to stretching. I know this because, plastic type B stretched an average length of 22.5 mm, this is larger than the three other plastics. Also, plastic type A had the most resistance to stretching because it only stretched an average length of b11mm. There is two ways to add validity and impede the experimental design. One way is to add a control to the groups and second, to have specific measurements for the amount of weight being added.
4170	2	0	The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results is add more weights to the clamp and take more time to change the data table.
4171	2	3	Based on the students data, plastics B and D are the most stretchable because they stretched the most in trial 1. Plastic B stretched 22 mm and plastic D stretched 20 mm. ^p The student could have specified how heavy the weights should be on the plastics. Also the student must use plastic samples of the same lengths so the results have more validity.
4172	2	0	What kind of plastic was it.
4173	2	2	You can conclude that plastic B stretched the most, and plastic A stretched the least. One way the experiment could be improvd is making sure each plastic is the same length before the stretch. Another is to do the experiment for different time intervals, like five, ten, and fifteen minutes instead of just five minutes.
4174	2	3	Based on the data, we can conclude that plastic type A is the strongest of the four. One way the student could have improved this experiment, would be to first measure a specific amount all of the plastic types. He could also specifically state the amount and heaviness of the weights & also make that a control.
4175	2	0	A conclusion I can draw based on the students data is that plastic type A stretched the shortest amount and that plastic type D didn't stretch at all but stretched the longest out of thin four types. One way that this design could have been improved is if the plastic types could have been named and the procedure should have added now high the table was in order to make the experiment work better.
4176	2	1	Plastic D it not even strectch. ^p B- include sofleg make is and start with the same mass for the plastic hags.
4177	2	1	The student's data was very accurate and it showed the less trechs plastic as well as the stretchiest plastic type. In the end the students could have improved the experiment by adding more trials to the experiment. Also more weighes on the plastics to have more accurate ressults.
4178	2	2	The students data is good the trial were coles in number. It seems that plastic type B was the streched with a lenth of 22 and 23 so the two trials helped the way. ^P I hes procedure he does not tell you what to meser in. He said to put a weight on the end but how much.
4179	2	1	The conclusion of this investigation is that plastic type A is the most provable because it stretched the most out of the four types. The student could have improve this investigation by using all plastic types that were the same length. Also the student could have extended the stand time for trial 2.
4180	2	2	a) The more weight that was added onto the plastic bag and one longer the weights were on the plastic bag, the more it had streched out. Out of all the plastic bags type D had the least amount of resistance to be streched, plastic bag type A had the most amount of resistance to be streched. ^P b) One way that the experiment could have been improved was the amount of weight could have been specified. A second way that the experiment could have been improved was more trials could have been conducted.
4181	2	1	a) Plastic types A & C are the least stretchy, whereas plastic types B & D are the most stretchy.^p 1 b) Define the original length as the plastic, and keep it constant for all four plastics. 2b) Use different sizes weights for the trial to see if their is a difference in data.
4182	2	1	A conclusion that be drawn from the data table is that the, plastic type B had the most weights although they could have improved their experiment by. Clamping are side to a table, which the other side was clamping something that held the weights they also could've included the bag type and lenghth and width.
4183	2	1	a) In conclusion, plastic type B stretched more than plastic type A, C, & D. The purpose of this experiment was to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability. Data shows that plastic type c stretched more than plastic type A, but plastic B stretched more than all of the plastic types. The student could have improved their design by labeling the plastics by name and adding it to procedure.
4184	2	2	a) Based on the recorded data, I am able to conclude that plastic B was a weak poly ethilen product in which it has the highest stretchability through out the experiment. ^p The group could deffinetly improve their design by having each sample of plastic at a constant length, therefor your results are more valid. Also the group could create intervals of time to show the results after 5, 10, or 15 minutes to see the fluctuation.
4185	2	3	a) Based on the students data, I can conclude the B stretched the highest and A stretched the least. ^P b) The students could have told us how much the weights weighed. They also could have told us the original length of the plastic before stretching it.
4186	2	0	The student should have made the procedure less.
4187	2	3	a) I conclude that plastic B was the highest stretching plastic according to the graph it stretched 23mm, plastic A is the least stretchable plastic it stretched only 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in trial two. ^P b) This experiment could have been improved by having each plastic stort at the same length and have the same amount of weight put on each plastic. The chart should include the original starting lengths of each of the plastics and the ending length.
4188	2	2	A.) Plastic type B stretched the most. ^p B.) They could have done multiple trials of each plastic.
4189	2	0	a) Basically these students are trying to see which one of these bags are more durable than the other how much weight it can take. ^p b) The first way the students could have improved is that the could have measure the plastic and the second way they could have improve is to see how long they should leave it on before the bags break.
4190	2	2	In conclusion the plastic material that was tested had a small amount of stretchability. In the experiment the plastic was strech at least 1mor millameter greater in the second trial versus the first trial also plastic type D was the only plastic that had no change within the two trials. Know two things I would change is first have the starting lengths of the plastic to see the difference from start to finish. Also specify how much weight you are laying on the end of the plastic.
4191	2	0	In conclusion, the plastic type have more amout stretched that the other one in both trial. For example in the first one he had 22 and the second he had 23.
4192	2	3	A conclusion drown based on the students' data would be plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the validity of the results is to have each type of plastic start at the same length. The students could have improved their experiment by putting the same amount of weights on each plastic.
4193	2	2	a) My conclusion is that plastic type  B is the most stretchable. ^p To make this experiment more exact like should have been more trial and their should also have a control test.
4194	2	0	As shown in the data, most of the test subjects stretch by one, with so, this project was a success. ^p 1. He could have use more time on the weights. ^p 2. He could have use different weights.
4195	2	3	a. Plastic B stretched the most at an avarage of 22.5 mm. ^p b. Add more trials. Explain how much waights are they using. How much of tape to use.
4196	2	1	A) In conclusion it seems as though plastic type D was the weakest plastic being least, as it stretched 20mm in each trial. The strongest appears to be plastic A, which barely stretched; it was as an average of 11mm.^p b) One way that the student would've made this experiment was to make sure the weights they were using were kept constant, as this could easily affect how much the plastics stretched. A second way the student could've improved these experiment would be to add weights and the drop of the bottom at the same time, then immediately start taking so all the vinegar being used is both constant as well as the amount of time it's left hanging pf the plastic.
4197	2	2	Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A stretched only 10 and 12 mm for each trial and plastic type B stretched 22 mm and 23 mm for each trial. ^p Two ways to improve this experiment. They probably should not use tape to hold the plastic on the table and they should try different amount of weights for different times.
4198	2	1	The conclusion of the different plastics is that mostly all the stretched further in the second trial then the first trial.^p One was the student could have improved the experimental design is instead of using a  clamp, just use the weights. And a second way the student could have improved the experimental design measure all plastics before anything else.
4199	2	0	Based on the data table I can conclude that plastic type A was a weaker or thinner plastic since it had stretched out the most. Also that plastic type D was strongest due to the fact that it didn't stretch at all. A validity issue is that plastic type C had shrunk in size when the test was to see it stretch.
4200	2	2	a. The conclusion I came to is that plastic type D has the least strength there for it stretched the most. ^p The student could have specified how many weights to add into each clamp. The student also could've made each sample of plastic the same length so it would have been easier to measure and conclude how much the plastic stretched.
4201	2	1	A.) That type B plastic is the strogest type of plastic they used in this investigation. It held the same while streching the most.^p B.) One way they could have improved there data is which way the plastic was held with or against which has a big import. Also they did not state how much weight.
4202	2	1	3A) I would conclude that with basicly all the plastic that are being used in the experiment. They are all very close in the amount stretched when they are all the same plastic typed from T1 to T2. ^p 3b) And two way that a student could have improved the experiment was maybe having a T3 to see if it would change any of the data anything and keep the weights and clamps till it broke to really see how much it stretched.
4203	2	0	My conclusion is that the numbers will go higher lowes and a way they can improve the trials is by putting more work in it, so it can be a good grade or data count.
4204	2	2	My conclusion is that for each plastic type it had stretched almost the exact same amount for both trials such as type D which had 20 for both trials. The students could have improved the experimental design by being specific as to how many weights should be added. They also should have written how far the cup should be hanging and to record their data.
4205	2	2	a. Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b. The student should have improved the experimental design by being more specific and indicating how much weight was added to the clamp. Also, the student could have experimented further by also testing the length of the bag after a longer period of time like 10 minutes.
4206	2	1	a) The table doesn't tell you much about how much they exactly stretched, the students only put what I assume the end length of the marble. Nothing can really be told with this information.^p (b) They should mention the types of plastics in the procedure because its not clear as to what materials they are referring to. Also they should have mentioned this in the table. On the table, the original lengths should have been recorded because otherwise you cannot tell how much it actually stretched.
4207	2	1	a) It is clear that plastic D is the least elastic and that plastic A is the most elastic plastic. ^p b) To improve the validity of the results the student could have done a third trial. And could have specified what the length was at each weight.
4208	2	0	a) In conclusion in the procedure it can be seen that plastic type A had the biggest difference in stretchability over the other polymer plastics.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are in either add more weight to the plastics or to let the weight being off the plastics for more than five minutes.
4209	2	2	"A. The conclusion that I drew is plastic type ""B"" was the best plastic for stretchability"". ^P B. One way the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much weight to add to the clamp. The results won't be as valid if one person adds a different amount of weight than another. ^P Another way the design could have been better is to tell the reader how much (in mm) of the bag should be taped to the table."
4210	2	1	Based on the students data for each trial, the amount of plastic stretched, it would first rise, decreased, then rise again. ^P B.) 1.) For the experimental design, they could have explained how much do the weights weighed. ^P 2.) The student should've showed what type of plastic he used.
4211	2	3	a) Plastic type B  is the plastic that stretched the most, plastic A was the one that stretched the least.^p b) The students can improve the experiment by adding another trial. Also we could have mentioned how much weight he put on the clamp.
4212	2	0	Based on the students data all of the types of plastics managed to stay around the same amount of being stretched. ^p I, the students could have shown constants, 2.)The students could have explained how the experiment was done a little bit more.
4213	2	2	Based on the students data I could conclude that the material that can stretch the most is plastic B. Thats because it was able to stretch 22mm the first trial and 23m  the second trial.^ (b)The students could have put the table what kind of plastics that were being used. In the procedure the students should have put how much the weight weighed.
4214	2	1	(1) He could of used the same amount of weight. ^p (2) Use a different conteince.
4215	2	3	The students data shows that plastic B stretched the most (22mm & 23 mm), however this may not be valid because you don't know if the length affecting this amount of stretching caused by the weights. The students can improve the results by using the same length for each plastic. Also, they can include how much weight to add to the drops in the procedure to improve the experimental design.
4216	2	2	A)A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type D had the same amount stretched for trial one and two, which was 20(mm).^p (b)Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity is by keeping the sample piece of the type of plastics the same. Also to use the same types of weights.
4217	2	1	a. Based on the students data plastic A stretched 2mm, plastic B stretched 1mm, plastic C didn't stretched it got stretch by 1mm and plastic D didn't change at all. ^P b. Two ways that the students could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results is, first by making the procedures more clear. Second, to make it more accurate the amount of weight should be the same since you're not measuring that and plastics should of been made of the same type of material.
4218	2	3	In the students experiment it is clear that polymer B is the most stretchable, than D, C, and last A. The students could use more trials, with these the experiment becomes more valid. The students also could have said the size of the plastics sample, since the size is in the final measurement, this could alter the results by a lot.
4219	2	1	(a) Polymer based plastic D didnt stretch at all. Plastic A stretched the most. ^p (b) Run more trials to make sure you get the same or close results and let the weights sit on the plastic longer than five minutes to see if more time is givin will it strech more.
4220	2	2	"A) Plastic type A and B have increased in length from the first trial to the second trial. While type C have decreased and type D have remained the same length. B) Two ways would have to be ) add a certain amount of weights to hang instead of saying, in step 4, add ""weights"". Anyone who is recreating this experiment would have different amounts. And 2) add more trials, adding will help other understant and read the data more clearly."
4221	2	3	A) Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchy, at 22.5mm average.^p B) The student could have improved the experiment by specifying the amount of weight used and the location on the table to put the tape, in case it is moved by the weights.
4222	2	3	A) B first the one plastic that's the stretchiest, while A is the least stretchiest C. ^P B) One way is by having a third trial to make shure, your data is corrected and by taking down how long the plastic was before you stretched it.
4223	2	2	Plastic B stretched the most for both trials.On trial one it stretched 22mm, on trial 2 it stretched 23mm.The plastic that stretched the least has plastic A. On trial 1 it stretched on trial 2 stretched 12mm. A way the student could have improved this is to add more weight to each plastic. And also another was to improve it is to have the plastics start at the same length.
4224	2	1	a) Based on the students data plastic type D is the constant and will always be ^p 20mm but B is stretchies. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved this would have been to indentify the types of plastic and how much weight was being added.
4225	2	1	In conclusion,the data shows that plastic. Type B has the best stretchability in this experiment. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by explaining what brand plastic he used for the experiment. He could have listed the materials be used in the experiment.
4226	2	2	A. To conclude, based on the data plastic type B has the most stretchability. Plastic type B was able to stretch 22 and 23mm while the closest streched (plastic type A) stretched 20 and 20.^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by telling a specific amount of weight and by being specific on what type of plastics they are using.
4227	2	0	b)The first would be to do second trial(t2) different then the first trial(t1) to be able to understand the difference of both experiment/ second would be to conduct a longer time setting to see how long it last.
4228	2	3	"a) Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B has the highest stretchability i.e lasticity. This is because B had stretched to 22 mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial2 which was more than other plastic types. b) One way the student could have taken each sample and measured  how long it originally was instead of only "" measuring the length of plastic types"" for "" three plastic samples"". Also, the student could have had a third trial instead of just trial 1 and trial 2, making the results more valid."
4229	2	0	In plastic type A there was a two milimeter increase between T1 and T2. Plastic type B only increase by one in its two trials. Type C had a decrease of one in the trials and D showed no signs of change. Plastic A seems to be the most stretchable polymer. These students could have improved their experiments by keeping the clamp and the weights on the plastic, stretch it and then measure to test the durability of the polymer as well.
4230	2	3	A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B stretched the most with a stretch of 23mm whereas all the other plastics stretched less than 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are to run more trials and in the instruction give a certain length or size of the plastic type because one plastic maybe stronger with more size giving you unaccurate results.
4231	2	3	a) You can't really draw a conclusion because, the length of the material (before it was stretched) was not recorded. But the plastic with the biggest is plastic B and the least is plastc A.^p b) They could measure the plastic before stretching and determine how large the weights should be.
4232	2	2	a) A good conclution for this would be that type be streched the furthest. ^P b) Two ways the students could have made this better would to have tested exactly what type of plastic to use and how long each peice should be.
4233	2	1	a.) In conclusion, plastic type A and B increased two or one mm. Plastic type C decreased one mm. And lastly plastic. Type D stayed the same. So the only affected ones were plastic type A, B, and C. ^p b.) One way the student could improve was to have another trial. And a second way the student could improve was to add different weights.
4234	2	3	The strongest plastic type was it because it stretched the most in both trials. The weakest was b because it stretched the most in both trials.  So two ways they could have been improved was stay long in a special place on the plastics and using the same clamps.
4235	2	2	(A) Based on the data graph it is clear the polymer B is the most strecthable because in T1 it stretched 22 cm and in T2 it strectched 23cm, beating the other polymers. ^p (B) The two ways they could have bettered this project is by 1, add more trials to it and 2. They could have validated more by writing their hypothesis to their experiment.
4236	2	0	My conclusion about this experiment is that T1 doesn't strech more than T2 and all types of plastic have more strech of equal than each other. Student could improve their result by making more steps to see what could happe for the next type of plastic if they stay the same lik plastic D or change.
4237	2	2	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the data is that plastic B has the best stretchability because their average amount stretched was at least 2.5mm more than any of the other plastics. However, based on the procedure the data is not completely reliable. One way to make it more reliable would be to make the weights added to the clamp constant because otherwise more weight could stretch the plastic farther, creating more than one independent variable. Another way to improve the validity of the results would be to add a control, for example a clamp with no weights for each type of plastic, to ensure that the independent variable, the plastic type, is what affects the dependent variable, the amount the plastic stretches.
4238	2	1	a) In conclusion putting the weights on each state, caused the plastic to stretch. It didn't stretch massively but it did make a difference. ^p b) One way the student could change it's experiment is by saying how much weight was on each state, or the student could have added the types of plastic samples.
4239	2	3	(a) The conclusion that could be drawn from the data is that after vetting the plastic hang for 5 minutes, attatched to a clamp and weights, plastic B had the most stretchability. It stretched to 22mm in the first trial, and 23mm in the second. It was stretched 12 mm than plastic type A, the least stretchable plastic, in trial 2, and 11 more mm in the second trial. ^p (b) To improve the validity of the data, the student could have kept the starting length of the plastic constant, and the weight of the weights added to the clamp, keeping vairables constant will bring at more valid results.
4240	2	3	Plastic type A had the least stretchability at an average of 11 mm while plastic type B stretched the most averaging at 22.5 mm. ^p The amount of weight added should be included in the procedure to make the test more valid. Preforming more trials will always make an experiment more valid in that could help here.
4241	2	2	It was concluded that plastic type B stretched the most amount in both the second and first trial. The student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials and having a control variables.
4242	2	0	Based on the student's data you can conclude that plastic type A has the most strechibility while plastic type C was the least amount stretched in the two trials while plastic type A's amount streched increased 2mm. Plastic type B's amount streched decreased 1mm two ways the student could have improved the experiment of design and/or validity of the results would be by adding weights and letting them hang for different periods of time and trying to strech them in different ways.
4243	2	2	A) Depending on the type of plastic will determine how much it will stretch with the added weights on it.^P B) The students could have tried it more times and they could have other types of plastic as well
4244	2	2	My conclusion are that plastic type B is the strechiest. It's the most durable and can hold the most height. ^P 1. Use the most durable tape you can find strong duet tape will probably be fine. ^P 2. Make sure all the plastic pieces are the same size and appropriate size.
4245	2	3	I conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B) All the plastics should have been the same length to begin with and make sure the same amount of weight is being put on the different types of plastics.
4246	2	2	Type D is the stretchiest & most constant of the plastics tells how much weight to put on clamps, tell how long the samples was.
4247	2	0	In conclusion, in trial2 the plastic stretched more than in trial .^p B) The students could of improved by indicating what kind of plastic and by allowing to let them hang longer.
4248	2	2	Plastic type B has the best stretchability. Plastic type D was in 2nd place with 20 mm for both trials. Plastic type C had 14mm for trial 1 and 13mm for trial 2. Plastic type A was the second. So plastic type B, with 22mm fro trial 1 and 23 for trial 2, is the winner.^p The students could have said how much weight is in the test. Another improvement could be to have 2 people and stretch the plastic, since stretchability is being tested.
4249	2	3	a) If plastic types are added weight to stretched the plastic B will stretch the farthest. This is supported by the data because in T1 and T2 it stretched the mos 22mm and 23mm ^p b)First they should have measured the in trial length so there is no confusing data.They also should have add more trials to improve the validity of the experiment.
4250	2	3	a) According to the data, plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least; it stretched 10mm the first time and 12mm the second time. Plastic C was the second strongest, followed by plastic D and then plastic B. ^p b) The student could have used the same weight or same amount of force on each bag. Also, the student could have used the same sized plastics for each plastic and each trial.
4251	2	2	A) According to the students data, polymer B stretched the most. ^P B) The student should specify the exact amount of weight to be attached to the plastic. The student should also specify which direction the plastic should be stretched, horizontally or vertically, because the direction of the polymer chains affects the stretchiness of the plastic. For example, a plastic shopping bag tears easily from top to bottom but does not tear easily from side to side because the polymer chains are running top to bottom.
4252	2	3	A. In conclusion plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. Plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic out of the 4 tested. ^p B. The student could've improved their experimental design by specifying the length of the plastics and by specifying how much the weights weighed.
4253	2	2	In trial 2 plastic type A stretched 2more millimeters than in trial , and plastic type D did not have any change. ^p The student could have completed more trials. Also the student could have how many weights before breaking.
4254	2	3	A) A conclusion is that plastic type B has stretched the farthest in both trial 1 reaching 22mm and in trial 2 reaching 23mm. The other 3 plastic types did not stretch as far as plastic B.^P B) The student could have improved the experiment by recording how long the plastics were before they were stretched and adding that data in the table. Also the student could have made sure each plastic was the same length and width before each of them were stretched. The student should have also listed the weight of the weights she used to stretch the plastic.
4255	2	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that in both ones plastic type B has to stretch larger than my op the other three plastics. This data is not valid because there are many places within the experiment to increase the validity. The students could have recorded the starting length and ending length. Also they should have add the amount of weights a controlled variable and lost but not least the group should have had a third trial.
4256	2	1	Plastic B is the easiliest streached plastic. ^p They could have done annother tryal with a different amount of weight. They could have tested more samples.
4257	2	2	A. Based on the student's data the conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic, type B had the most stretchability.^p B. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to include exactly what plastics were used. Also they could have added what step weights they used to stretch the plastics.
4258	2	3	a) Based on the data ,I can assume that plastic B has the most stretchability because on both trials it stretched 21 and 23mm while the next closest only stretched 20mm.^p b) One way the student could here improved the experiment design is to start with the same length of each plastic without othey are constant .Also the student could have specified the amount of weight that was out on the clamp and the  student could also have made the amount of weight a constant.
4259	2	0	In trial 1vs trial 2 there wasn't a tremendous difference in lengths. If anything happened at all the length rised about 10 12 millimeters. Sample A had the least amount of millimeters but changed the most, while sample D had the most amount of millimeters and didn't change at all. ^p 1 Use different sample of the same plastic for second trial. ^p 2 Make sure they are all coming from same temperature.
4260	2	2	A)Plastic type B stretched more than any type in both of its trials. (B)The student could have made sure each plastic was the same size to begin with. Also the student could have added the premier measurement to the chart, so he/she could draw more accurate conclusions.
4261	2	0	Draw a investigation is meatanese.
4262	2	3	a) After recording the data, it is obvious that plastic type B can stretch the furthest and plastic type A stretches the least furthest. ^P b) One thing he could have done to improve his experiment was to list the weight as the weights because if there were different weights the entire experiment is forfeit. Another thing he could have done was to list the original length of plastic to see how much it actually stretched.
4263	2	2	C. A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B, C are the most resistant. ^p The students could improve the experiment by trying it a third time, and saying the amount of plastic use for all 4 plastic used. This is how the students can improve the experiment to have a more valid result.
4264	2	3	Based on the students data, polymer plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because the millimeters stretched on B trial 1 and 2 exeeded that of any other plastic (22mm & 23mm). The students could have included a third trial to increase the validity of the experiment. The student also could made sure each sample of plastic began at the same length. (control)
4265	2	2	a) The A plastic stretched the most while plastic C shrunk an inch and D did not stretch at all. B stretched an inch concluding that A was the most stretchable plastic. ^p b) They could have said how long to cut the plastic types and how much weight should be put on the clamp.
4266	2	0	Based on the information from the table, plastic type A has more stretchability than the rest. ^p The student could've tested longer because like I said before, time is a factor in determining things when testing. Also, the student should've added weights to the second trial.
4267	2	2	I can conclude that plastic B streatchs out the most and plastic A streachs out the least. I know this because plastic B streatches 22 to 23, and plastic A streachs 10-12. Two was to improve this experiment is to tell what type of plastic, and to add four more trials.
4268	2	1	Plastic B is a material that is the most flexible. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is having a control and measure all the plastics the same length when the experiment initiated. A control will allow the student to compare data & the constant will increase the data's validity.
4269	2	1	A. The polymer material B was the best in stretchability. The polymer D was 3rd C was 2nd and A was the worst.^p B. 1. They could have gave the polymer more time to stretch instead of just 5 min. 2. They could have done test different polymers.
4270	2	0	The plastics did not stretch as much in trial 2 (T2) as they did in trial 1 (T1).^p The student could've explained what we were looking for maybe with a hypothesis. They also could've identified the plastic types.
4271	2	1	Based on the data shown in the table, I can conclued that plastic type D was to strech the most. Also that plastic type A streched the least. ^p The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials and by telling the types of plasic used for the experiment.
4272	2	1	The needed more trails. Also could more infomation, and the most streched ploymer was 23.
4273	2	1	It is a good experiment with nice ideas and it shows which plastic is most flexible. The first way to improve the test is to use different brand name plastics to test the difference. Neat you need to do 3 trials to see if the lab is valid.
4274	2	0	Plastic type A is definately the streatchiest where as plastic type D is the least stretchy. The student could have improved his experiment in many ways. 2 of these ways include: letting the plastic stretch more. The students should have waited longer than 5 minutes. The other way he/she could have improved the experiment is by: having a greater variety of plastics. The student only tested 4 types of plastics when there are many more.
4275	2	0	The plastic stretch out about the same they don't  have that much difference. The students could have kept adding weight to see how far the plastic would stretch. They should have gone deeper and actually figured out the exact difference.
4276	2	3	The student's data clearly shows tat plastic B has the most stretchability. In that one it stretching to 22 mm, and in trial two it stretched to 23. Plastic D was a close second with 20 mm for  both trials. Plastic C stretched 14 mm the first trial and 13 the second. Finally plastic A stretched the least. It is obvious that plastic B was the stretchiest in Comparison to the others with 10 mm in the first trial and 12 in the second. To improve the experimental design of the students could make sure the pieces of plastic are the same length also they could use the same clamp and weights to ensure that the weigths added
4277	2	3	Based on the student's data, it is clear that plastic type B is the most stretchy because it was able to stretch 22mm and 23mm. Plastic type A was the least stretchable because it was only stretched 10mm and 12mm. This is a difference of about 10mm. ^p The students should have specified the length of the plastics making it consistent for all the different types would ensure a valid experiment in which only one variable was tested. Also, they should have given a specific weight to be added to the clamp measure this you would have made the experiment more valid.
4278	2	0	A) A conclusion that could wiads from the students data is that trial 1 and trial 2 both basically had the same number if it could be one higher or one lower. Also, the plastic type D is the most stretchable to both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by not only trying one experiment, testing it in four 1-10 trials. Also the student could have been more specific with the plastic types.
4279	2	2	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic A stretched the farthest out of all the other types during the second trial. Another conclusion would be that plastic type D didn't stretch at all and stayed durable, which means it's the strongest, throughout the 1st and the 2nd trial. Two ways this experiment would be obtaining at minimum 3 trials to test its validity and the other would be to identify the type of plastic and more importantly start at the same length of each plastic to keep the validity of the experiment valid.
4280	2	2	As you can see, plastic type A stretched the least and type B stretched the most. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment design would be to tell whatt. They are doing with the plastic and do a third trial. The purpose of the experiment is unknown.
4281	2	2	According to the students data we can now conclude that plastic B is the strechiest, Streching 22mm and 23mm on the second trial. But one way the students could have emproved their expeirement is with in the procedure they should make it cleat that you need to have two of the same types of plastic for both trials so your not using the same one. Another way it could be improved is to explain how mezy and how much weight is being used and specify that each plastic should use the same weight.
4282	2	2	a. In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable out of the group of plastic because in trial 1, plastic B stretched 22mm and in trial 2, plastic B stretched 23mm. This compares to plastic A, that stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12mm on the second trial, which was the least stretchable. ^p b) The students conducting this experiment could have named specific plastics instead of saying 'take a sample of plastic'. Also, the students could have taken measurements as the 5 minutes were passing. Multiple trials would have also helped prove the validity of this investigation.
4283	2	0	a) Conclusion - plastic Type A stretched the least and plastic Type D the most. ^p 1. name type of plastic being used 2. what kind of weights are being used.
4284	2	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B was the most flexible plastic A streches the least with an average growth of 11mm while in comparison, plastic B had an average strech of 22.5mm. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experiment design and be the validity of the experiment are, specify the a from of weight used and on another trial with heavier weights. This will further parsue the plan and make sure all data accurate. Another thing the student could do to enhance the validity of the experiment is to start out with the same amount of each platic, instead of measuring different lengths to start with.
4285	2	1	In conclusion plastic type B had the best flexibility of 22-23mm amount stretched, while A had 10-12mm,C had 14-13mm,and D had 20-20mm stretched. So type B the best. Two ways improved their experiment is by using something other than a clamp, thats also add on weight ,and to show on their data table how much weight the stretch could withstand.
4286	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can make a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the most. Two way to improve this experiment for better results is on have a control. They also can have more trials to make it more valid.
4287	2	2	I can draw a conclusion that A had the best stretchability with T1=22 and T2=23. I am also conclude that plastic A had the best stretchability at T1=10, T2=12, what the student could have done to test her validity she could have had the amount of weight and she could have gives the names of the plastic.
4288	2	0	They could of allowed the clamp to hang for 10 minutes. They could of put more weight on the clamp.
4289	2	2	A) Based on the student's data plastic B was the plastic that stretched the longest in both trials because it went 22mm and plastic A only went 10mm. In trial 2 plastic B went 23mm and plastic D only went 20mm. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are by telling us how much weight to put in the clamp and having the average of both trials.
4290	2	3	Plastic type B stretched the most compared to the other plastics while plastic C did not stretch at all. The students could improve the experiment by listing the starting measures of each plastic and performing three trials instead of 2.
4291	2	2	A conclusion I can make based on the student's poulded data is that plastic type B was able to be stretched the farthest. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results is you should try the experiment at different temperatures ( not stretches the plastic would cold compressed the items of the polymer) and list the weights they used (how heavy they were).
4292	2	2	a)From this information I come to conclude plastic type B stretched the most out the four types. Plastic type D came next, then C, the A.^p (b)This student could made this lab better in two ways, they could have told us how much weight to put on the plastics, and they could have explained more how to measure it, with inches or milimeters.
4293	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability with an average of 22.5 mm stretch, followed by plastic type D, averaging 20 mm, then plastic type C, averaging 13.5 mm, then the plastic with the lowest stretchability was plastic type A, averaging 11 mm of stretch. ^P B) The student could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results by including that all the plastic types were equally cut and measure. They could have also included to use the same amount of weights for each trial or experiment.
4294	2	3	In conclusion the graph shown states that plastic (type B) streched the most compared to the rest of the types of plastic. ^P One way the student can improve this experiment would he to use the same weights for each type of plastic. Another way would be to cut the same size of plastic for each type and trial.
4295	2	2	A)Plastic type D stretched the most .^p They could have done 3 trials instead of two. They could have told you the weight measurement.
4296	2	2	"Plastic types A, B, C, and D all stretched out over 10 mm in the first trial. On the second trial plastic type ""C"" stretched out only 13mm less than trial one. ^p Constant amount of weight. They could have also improved it by more trials."
4297	2	2	a. Based on the students data I can conclude that the plastic bag B and D are the least desirable bags because they stretched far when the warm and weight were added  plastic bags A and C where the most durable because they eld most stretch as far  when the weights were added. (b) One way the students could have improved the their design is by making all the bags length the same. The student also could have made the weights a specific number so that all the types of plastic had the same amount of weight pulling on it.
4298	2	2	Based on the data I would say that plastic type B streached the most for both trials.^p The students didn't tell how big the weights were and they didn't have a control test.
4299	2	2	a.) Based on the student's data,  plastic type B had the most stretchabilty, or was the stretchiest plastic.^p b.) The students could have used a control, for example a non plastic to compare the stretchabilty and to help make a better conclusion and analysts. The students could have used the same amount of weight for each plastic and each trial, so that they wouldn't use more and different plastics and to ensure the accuracy/validity of their data.
4300	2	2	Plastic B was the strongest out of all four plastics. Two ways that the experiment could have been improved is to have more trials and specific measurements.
4301	2	0	The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity as the results and mave to decrease the differ as amount stretched an up from T1 to T2.
4302	2	0	A) I can conclude that plastic A stretched the longest (2mm) and that plastic C did not stretch, but decreased in length from 14mm to 13mm (1mm). ^p B) Students could measure all the plastics aat the once and they could do something else.
4303	2	2	The table shows that plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastic types. Plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial one and stretched 23mm in trial two. Plastic type D stretch 20mm in both trials, them plastic type C stretched 14mm in trial one and 13mm in trial two and plastic Type A stretched 10mm in trial one and 12mm in trial two. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment design and/on validity of the results are that they could have used the exact same weights everytime and said what types pf plastic they used.
4304	2	1	a) Plastics will stretch and bend when weight is being applied to one end causing the plastic to be changed. ^p b) The students could have listed the types of plastics being used and listed the original length.
4305	2	1	A. The students data clearly shows that the more you data plastics A and B the longer they get but it is the opposite for C and D, they only get stronger.^p B. The students could have done 3, 4, or even 5 tests something can go wrong in 1 test, multiple tests would have shown more constant results. Lastly, a materials list should have been added to help a person prepare for the experiment.
4306	2	2	A-A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plastic type B polymers with the most stretchability.^p B-Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would be one, change the hanging time from five minutes to two or three and two, add a third trial to make results more valid.
4307	2	1	A- My conclusion is that if the student kept on stretching this plastic type it would probably snapon the 3rd time. ^p B- Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by testing a third trial. Another way is the student could have put more weight on the plastic to see how the weight affected the plastic.
4308	2	3	(A) Plastic type b is the most stretchable plastic of all the bags because it stretched 22mm (Trial 1) & 23 (trial 2) while the other plastics didn't stretch as much. ^p (B) The student could've improved the experimental design by stating how many weights to place on the plastic and how much each weight weighs. Also, they could've stated how much of the plastic should be taped onto the table and how much should hang freely.
4309	2	3	a) The conclusion drawn from this student's data is that plastic B is the most stretchable because it was the one that remained firm for the longest time.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved his procedure are, he could have specified on how many weights to add to the clamp and how heavy they should be. He could also have specified if each plastic needed to be the same length.
4310	2	1	(a)Plastic A with amount of stretchness was 10-13, and plastic C stretchness was 14-13 had the lowest stretchness. Plastic B and D with the stretchness around 20-23 were the highest ones with more stretchness. ^p (b) Two ways the students could improved the experimental design or validity of the results is by making more trials and making sure they measured the same amount of stretchiness correctly, to be secure.
4311	2	0	Add the fist two togahtr and that how I do it?
4312	2	1	1) Acording to the data, plastic B stretched the most, and with the exeption of D, the second trial tests only differed by 1 or 2 mm, from the first test. ^p 2) To have improved the experiment, the student could have stretched the plastics longer. The second time on used heavier weights during te second trial.
4313	2	3	After the experiment was over we concluded that plastic type B has been stretched the furthest from the weights pulling it down. Plastic type D was the second most stretched plastic then after that was plastic type C, and finally plastic type A. ^p The students didn't show how long the plastic was before stretching it. So we didn't know if all bags were the said length to start out. Another improvement could've have been telling exactly how much weight was added to the end of the bags.
4314	2	0	To end our experiment we calculated our data together. For plastic type A, for T1 we got 10 for T2 we got 12. For B we got T1 22 and T2 12. For C we got T1 14 and T2 13. Last for plastic type D T1 was 20 and T2 20. The students could of used less weight for step 4. The student also let the clamp hang longer with 10 more minutes.
4315	2	2	i conclude that plastic B stretched the most. Its T1 was 22 and its T2 was 23 A,C,D their T1 and T2 was lower but D had 20 for T1 and T2. for validity the students could have done the weights for all the plastic together instead of doing it separate, they could have done three trials instead of 2 trials.
4316	2	2	It appears that plastic type B stretched out the most and plastic type A stretched out the least. One way that the student could have improved their experiment would be to tell what kind of plastic to do. Also the student should have put how big the plastic was in the begining.
4317	2	3	A.) A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is plastic type B has more Strechability than the other ones. ^p Two ways a student could improve the experiment design could be add more trials the minimum is three, and also make sure the plastic are all the same size to begin with. Doing this could also increase the validity of the of the experiment and make it more accurate.
4318	2	0	They could of added more weight and they could of let it hang for more than 5 min. The con clusion I have based on the student's data is that (T2) was more stretch out than (T1).
4319	2	0	A conclusion for the graph could be what they did to get to the end of their experiment.^p B. One way the student could improve their self is by make there product better so the numbers stay higher instead of always decreasing. Another way is to make sure everything is all right.
4320	2	2	A. The plastic polymer with the most stretchablity was plastic type B. this is because it stretched 22 and 23mm. B. Two ways the student could told you what type of plastics they were using and how much weight was applied to stretch out the plastics.
4321	2	1	In the trials the plastic type B stretched the farthest so from this least it is the strongest. b The students could have improve their experiment by running 1 more trial for validity and a control to compare to.
4322	2	1	A) For the most part all of the plastics changed in some way except for one type. ^p B) The student could have done the experiment more then just two times, to see how his/her answers might have verifed.
4323	2	3	a) My conclusion on this experiment is plastic type A is the stronger because it stretched the least.^p b) 2 ways that could of improved the experiment are make the plastic the same size and use the same amount of weights.
4324	2	3	a. Based on the data, I conclude that plastic type B Stretched the most during both trials. ^p b. Two ways the students could've improved their experiment was making the plastics all the same length before stretching them. Also, specify what types/size weighs because one person could put on a 1 pound weight and someone else could put on a 2 pound weight and get completely different results.
4325	2	1	a) Based on the data type B stretched the most in both trials then any others. Type B had more elatistity and type A had the least elastisity. ^p b) This student could improve this experiment by recording the amount it stretched every 2 minutes. Also stating whether the same plastic used in T1 is used in T2.
4326	2	1	Based on the students data the conclusion will be that plastic B works better than the others in the first trial plastic B had 22 mm and the second trial plastic B had 23 mm.^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design are to repeat the experiment. Another way is to add a control.
4327	2	2	A) Plastic type B was the stretchest plastic type because in trial 1 it got 22 mm and it trial 2 it got 12 mm. ^p B) The student could have had the plastic types start at the same lengths and could have changed the experiment the which plastic is the most discrible.
4328	2	3	A) In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most, ending up at 22 and 23 mm, respectively.^p B) Two ways the student could've improved the design/validity of the results is including how much weight is put on the clamps, and also including the original size of plastic to begin with.
4329	2	1	A) The conclusion I have drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most flexibility and plastic A has the least.^p B) Two ways the student could have improved his/her data is by measuring each plastic before he/she stretched it out. The also could have.
4330	2	1	b)The student could have improved by describing how many weights are used and how much they weighed.
4331	2	3	I would say that plastic tape B has the most streachability, two ways the student could improve their designs would be to have a specific amount of weight so the expiriment is valid and they could add a third trial to make the expiriment more valid.
4332	2	1	My conclusion to the experiment is that the best working plastics ar A &B because they stretched out the most the second time. The student could have run another trial and also added more weights to make sure it would really stretch.
4333	2	2	(A) Overall, plastic type B had stretched the most. Plastic type B just stretched a little further. This means that plastic type B had the most resistence to the weights/clamps and this plastic would be the most durable to use B. One way to improve the design would be to measure all the plastics to the same length so the results come out more accurate. Another way could be to have weights all be the same weight so some plastic types don't have advantage over others.
4334	2	1	a) The conclusion I drew from this experiment is that plastic D stretched the most. It stretched 20mm while plastic A only stretched 12 mm.^p b) The student could have replaced the samples before the second trial and made all of the sample the same length.
4335	2	3	A. From the data you can conclude that the plastic type B stretched the furthest. ^p B. The the could have done more experiments and they could tell how much weight so start out with.
4336	2	1	The students could have averaged the two lengths of each plastic to get only one number for each. They also should have done one more trail to make it reliable.
4337	2	3	a.) The student's data shows that plastic type B had stretched the most out of the four types of polymer plastics. ^p b.) One way the students could've improved the design and/or validity of the results would be to make a third trial, seeing as some of the results were changed.  Another way would've been to tell the reader what weights to use and to make sure to use the same ones.
4338	2	1	Based on the student's data T2 seems to be able to stretch just a little more compared to T1. Two ways to improve the experiment would be of course more trials and more valiability. The student could get different brands of plastic from grocery stores and test which is more stretchable.
4339	2	0	-I think that the plastic types is going to be more danger because the student have add clamp to the bottom of the plastic types. not only that but what the student could have done is to make the plastic type hung for more than 5 minutes and they could ha
4340	2	2	Based on the experiment, plastic type B was the stretchiest because it stretched the most from the weights placed in it. Two ways in which the students could have improved the experiment are specifying the number weights and how much they could weigh. If the students did not use the same amount of weights for each plastic then these plastic are invalid.
4341	2	1	My conclusion to the students data is that the sample that was used wasn't the correct form of solution, and I think if they added make there experiment would've been successful.
4342	2	1	a) I conclude that plastic B is more strechable because it has the most (higher) length which is 23 and two trials. ^p The student could have take a longer table and do all the plastic and attached the clamp in all of them while the one before was hanging for 5 mins.
4343	2	2	Plastic type B stretched longer then all the other plastic types. B T1 was 22 and T2 was 23 is stretched the most weights in 5 minutes. They students could have improved their experiment by doing another trial like T3 and see which plastic type held the most weight.
4344	2	1	a.The conclusion I drew form the student's data is that the plastic types A stretched out about the same each trial except for plastic type D which stayed the same ^p b. Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design or validized their results is by increasing the # of weights and or time of the trials. Also, another way that could have made their results more valid is by having more than just results more valid.
4345	2	2	2) I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most amount out of all the other plastics. ^P b) The students could improve the experimental design by adding more trials and adding a control.
4346	2	3	A) When we tested four different polymer plastics to see which ones increased in length after adding weights, the results read that plastic B increased the most by 22-23mm. The plastic that increased by 10-12mm. ^p B) One way the students could have improved their procedure was by specifying how much weight they added to the plastics. Another way to improve validity is to add a third trial to the experiment.
4347	2	2	The conclusion I have drawn based on the students data is that plastics B and D are the best polymers because those were the two plastics that had stretched the farthest on both trials. ^p Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to do even more trials. Also they would need to make sure that the free edge hanging from the plastics are the same length each time.
4348	2	2	A) From the information of the graph I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most for both trials the amount stretched was the highest. ^p 3b) Ways those students could improve there expirement, is by being more detailed in those procedure. Another way would be to perform more trials and even have another group recreate the experiment and compare notes.
4349	2	2	Plastic B is the strongest with the length of 23. One why the student could improve their results is how much the weights weigh. Another way is how heavy was the clamp.
4350	2	0	In conclusion based on the student's data, plastic type D had the same amount stretched 20mm. However, Plastic type A had 10mm the first trial and it stretched more to 12 on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by writing the types of plastic instead of type A,B,C and D. Another way the students could have improved is by adding a prediction to what they thought was going to happen.
4351	2	1	According to the chart Trial 1 was more effective than trial 2. The student couldve improven the experimet by using different materials than plastic. Or do at least one more trial. (T3)
4352	2	3	I conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable, followed by type D, followed by type C, followed by type C, followed by type A. One way the experiment could be improved is by listing the starting/ending lengths of the strips and to make sure all of the plastic starts at the same size. Another way to improve is to perform more than 2 trials.
4353	2	1	a. Plastic type A is the most stretchable and type d is not stretchable at all. ^p b. That student could of done more trials of each plastic type and done a control of each.
4354	2	1	Based on the data plastic type B can be stretched more than the other plastics.^p 1. They could have said the type of plastic used. 2. They could have added the average stretch.
4355	2	3	"Based upon the student's information "" by performing this experiment, plastic type B has stretched the most on average by 22.5 millimeters. Plastic type D come in 2nd with 20 mm. Type C in 3rd with 13.5 and type A in just with 11. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by first allowing a length every plane of tape should be before starting. The student could also provided a number of weights or amount of weight applied to are placed of type, all of which should have the same amount."
4356	2	2	a) The conclusion based from the student data would be the more weights added to the plastic types the more likely it would be for the plastic to stretch. ^p b) The student could improve the experiment design by adding specifically how much the weights weigh. Another improvement would be to do more trials.
4357	2	2	Based on the data found by the students in the polymer investigation plastic B had the most tensile strength or could stretch the most tensile plastic A had the least tensile strength. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by performing 3 or more trials for validity. Also the student could have included the weight of each weight that was stretching the plastic.
4358	2	2	a) My conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the farthest and plastic type A is thicker because it didn't stretch as much.^p B) The student should have only did 3 trials and they should have told us what kind of plastic was used for the experiment.
4359	2	3	3. a) According to the results, plastic type A is the strongest because it stretched the least (in mm is the first trial and 12 mm in the second ). Plastic type B is the weakest out of the four because it stretched the most(22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second). b) These are ways the student could have made their experiment better.1) Take all plastic samples with the same length. 2) Add weights into the clamp until the plastic stretches out to its full potential rather than ileting it hang for five minutes. 3) Do a third trial.
4360	2	1	In conclusion, the plastics were expirimented and plastic that had the potential to strech most was plastic B which results were 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. The one that least stretched was plastic A with 10mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. All the other plastics results that were tested were in between.
4361	2	0	It seemed as if the plastic stretched further or stayed the same in these trials. Type A stretched from 10mm to 12mm. Type B 22mm to 23mm. Type C 14mm to 13mm, and type D 20mm to 20mm. ^p B) The student should have been more specific with their table. the student also could have stated his validity better in or while doing his experiment.
4362	2	3	a) According to the data it can be inferred that plastic B's polymer plastic stretches the most compared to the other plastics. It can also be concluded that the data is prease due to the closeness of the number from the 1st trial to the 2nd trial.^P b.) The student could improve the experimeat by having the amount of plastic used a constant. This allows the student to have only one independent variable. (The type of plastic). They can also explain that the weights most be the same weight for plastic, so the data is not effected.
4363	2	2	a) B stretched out the most because it stretched out, a total of 45(mm) A 22, C27 and D 40. B) One way to improve the lab is instead of two trials do three. Find waay is have a control grone.
4364	2	1	Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment is by adding materials and also doing the experiment again.
4365	2	3	A) I can conclude that the plastic type B stretched the most. It stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial.^p B) One way this experiment could be improved is by adding more trials. Another way that this experiment could,by improved is by telling or starting how long was each plastic type before stretching it.
4366	2	2	A. Based off of the data table plastic B had the greatest stretch with 23mm while plastic A had the least with 10mm estretch.^p B Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to have more trials and also have a control
4367	2	3	a)Polyme B has the most stretchability, whilepolyme A has the least stretchability.^p (b)The students should have included the measurements of the initial and final lengths the plastics samples. They also should've recorded the amount of weight they used.
4368	2	3	Based on the students data I concluded that Plastic type B was most stretchable and A was the least stretchy. To improve the validity at this experiment they could have included the starting length, how much the weights weighed ad also could of condicted a third or more trials.
4369	2	0	The student showed that some plastics could be stretched by weights.
4370	2	3	a) One conclusion that I determined according to the data was that plastic type B stretched the most overall in both trial 1 and 2. Another conclusion one could draw is that when conducting the experiment on plastics type D, it was probably the most reliable and had many controls, because the amount stretched (mm) stayed exactly the same. ^p b) One way the student have improved the experiment design was by measuring the same side of bag for A,B,C,D( in# 1) Another could be to add equal weights (#4) to each type of bag.
4371	2	2	Based on the students data the polymer plastics all had had different weights because all stretched out differently. To better the experiment the lab needs to include the stretching measurement so there can be data to compare before & after. Another thing would to for all plastics is store on the same length. This data is neccary to make just numbers on a graph to data.
4372	2	3	In T1 and T2 B stretched out the most durring the 5 minutes.^p The student could improve his experiment by doing an extra trial for a more valid result. As well the student could have stated in the experimental design the weights heavieness.
4373	2	3	A) Based on the the data given to us in the answer banklet plastic type B stretched out the most compared to all the other plastic types in both trials. ^p B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding more trials which would of made the experiment more accurate another way would be specifying how much the weight and clamp actually weighed.
4374	2	2	A) Plastic type B 's polymer has the most stretchability as shown in both trials and the polymer type in B is similar to the polymer in D due to the fact that their results are closest. Polymer in A is not very strecher nor is the one in C. ^P B) Ways to improve both the design and validity include using something strongest than tape to hold up the plastic and weight, also using a timer to improve valibility.
4375	2	3	A) According to the results of the students plastic B was stretched out the most. For plastic A the results are 10 mm for T1 and 12 mm for T2. For plastic B the results are 22 mm for T1 and 23 for T2. Plastic C the results are 14 mm for T1 and 13 mm for T2. Lastly for plastic D the results are 20 mm for T1 and 20 mm for T2. B) One way the students could have improved their experiment was they could have done more trials with the different types of plastic. Another way they could have improved was to show how many weights they used and what kind of plastic they used so we could see the effect they had according to the type.
4376	2	0	a. The student bottles have stretched more during was first atempt and plastic B was stretched the most during both.^p b. The student could have improved his experiment by using 2 bottles to tape and not dorpping the other two bottles.
4377	2	0	two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is they could of did a little more and took there time to make things good and do there best.
4378	2	3	Upon the completion of the experiment, it was concluded that plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic B stretched on aver age 22 mm, while Plastic A stretched an average 11mm, plastic C stretched an average 13.5 mm, and plastic D stretched an average 20mm. Two ways that the group could have improved their experiment would be to include how big the clamp is and to include how much weight is being added to the clamp.
4379	2	2	Based on the students data i have come to the conclusion that plastic D is the most reliable polymer because it stretches the most. By giving the measurement of plastic used for each trial the student could have improved the experiment design. Also, by writing the amount of weights they use, the students could have improved his experiment design.
4380	2	3	A) Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design would be to state how much weight to add to the clamp, and to do 3 trials with an average instead of just two with no average.
4381	2	2	A.) Plastic a and b stretched more from trail one to to trail 2. (Plastic C went down one and D stayed the same. B.) Two ways the students could have, improve the experimental design or validity of the results is they could have have done another trail for each plastic. Also they could have made sure all of the plastic were the same length to start off with.
4382	2	3	Based on the students trials, plastic type B was the best one because it allowed the most stretching. In its first test it scored the highest of 22mm, and then in test 2 scored 23 mm, also the highest. Plastic type B will stretch the most if weights was put on it and for 5 minutes. 6P (A) The student could have improved this lab by adding specific measurements to certain steps such as how much weight should be added in step 4. (B) The student could have also improved rethis lab by making each plastic the same length. In step 1 to just said to measure it, not to cut it to a certain length. If you make each one the same length the results will all be accurate.
4383	2	1	Plastic type A stretched longer the second that, so did plastic type B. Plastic type D stretched the same both trials. The student could of named the types of plastic or test it more than two times.
4384	2	0	A) The stretchability for the four different types of polymer plastics. The calculations for trial one and trial two we almost the same. For example plastic type A on trial one it was 10 and trial 2 it was 12 then on plastic type D for both trials it was 20. ^p The two ways they could have improved it was by putting weights in and making it heavier and the other one is you can also bring the plastic bags apart trying to rip them.
4385	2	2	The conclusion in this experiment is that plastic type B is the most stretchability. When the students added the weight to the plastic and it stretched out to do the longest in both trials. Trial 1 it was 22mm and in trial 2 it was 23mm. 2 was that the students would of improved this experiment is to perform more trials to receive the most accurate answer, and they could of had control and see how the plastics stretch with no weight on them.
4386	2	3	Based on the students data, Plastic Type B stretched the most. In the first trial it stretched 22 mm and in the second trail it stretched 23 mm. The second most trial pliable material stretched 20 mm. The student could have improved the design by using samples that were exactly the same length. Also, he/she could have stated how much weight they were using to stretch the material.
4387	2	3	Based on the data I can conclude they plastic B and D are the most flexible, to improve the experiment students could have cut all the samples to the same length and they could have preformed more trials.
4388	2	2	"A)Plastic type B had the best stretchability while A had the worst. Type B stretched an average of 7.3 units longer in T1 And 8 units in T3.^p (B)In their procedure they could've put measuring units (be ""inches, millimeters, etc) that they used. they could've specified the amount of weight they were using in step #4."
4389	2	3	According to this student's data, plastic type B is the most stretchable of the types tried. Both trials you did and start do'n saying that it was stretched further than the other 3 samples, which the data keeps accurately valid. The experiment design was poor. One way this student could have improved their design is to have been more specific in measurements, the size of the plastic samples, how much hangs, are the tight, etc. Another way to improve the validity of their results is to perform more than just 2 trials.
4390	2	2	The data that the student got is corrupted. The reason I say this is because he/she should have wrote on the data table the starting measure of each bag. He/she could have also used the same amount of weight written it on the procedures to get more accurate results. Another way that the student could have improved would be doing another trial to make that the results are accurate.
4391	2	3	In conclusion to the data gathered by the students I have come to the conclusion that the polymer plastic type A has streched the least therefore making it the most stable. And that polymer plastic type B was the least to strech the most therefore being the least stable. The students could have increased the validity of there results by adding more variables such as amount of weight applies. As well as adding even more trials.
4392	2	3	a) It can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A, the least. ^p b) The student could have improved the experiment by using plastics that were all the same length and mass. For example, if B was a sample of plastic 1100 decametres long, of course it would stretch farther than the rest. Also, another problem going off of that is that the mass of the weights should remain consistent. Secondly, to make elasticity certain more trials from different students should be done, to make sure that the results are valid.
4393	2	2	A) According to the data table testing the stretchability on 4 different polymer plastics, plastic B is the stretchiest because it stretched 22-23mm. The other types of plastics didn't stretch this much. ^P B) One way this experimental design could be improved is to say the 4 different kinds of plastics used. Another way this can be improved is to tell us how much weight to add to the clamp when stretching the plastic.
4394	2	2	To inquire hi experiment be could of said how much weight he added the the plastic bags. Each one was to have the same amount of weight. Second he should or had same type of measure ment on how long the bags where befor he did the experiment, then show how long they got.
4395	2	3	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic is worked the best for both trials with 22 mm for that I and 23mm for trial 2. Plastic D not 20mm for both trials. Plastic C with 14mm and 13mm and the least stretchy was plastic A with 10mm and 12mm. B) Two ways they could have improved was to name the polymers such as BP. They also could have said how much the clamps and the weights weighed.
4396	2	1	a) Polymers C appears to have the greatest amount of streach ability. ^p b) The student could have added a control and performed more trials.
4397	2	0	(A) The student found the two stretched plastics to be B and D. They both have over 20 mm in both trials and performed much better than the two other trials. ^p (B) The student could have improved his procedure of experiment by giving a hypothesis of just which plastic they thought would be the stretchiest. After that they needed as if there hypothesis was correct and if not explain why it wasn't.
4398	2	2	a) A  conclusion based on the student's data would be that plastic type A would be the stretchiest plastic because it stretched the most at two mm, while type B and C stretched one mm, and type D didn't stretch at all.^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to record the measure of plastic before stretching on the data table, and also to add more trials.
4399	2	3	Plastic B is the most stretchy. ^p The student should have made sure all of the plastics were the same length before preforming the experiment. If all the plastics are different lengths we have no way of knowing if they stretched because of the length or because of the type of plastic. He or she should also have indicated the weight attached to the clamp. Otherwise the experiment cannot be repeated but repetition is an essential part of validity.
4400	2	2	(a) Plastic B stretched the longest in trial 2 23 mm and plastic D being the second longest and A having the shortest amount stretched. ^p (B)  The student could have had the clamps hang a longer time rather than just 5 minutes and they could of had a third trial because some plastic stretched longer the second time round.
4401	2	0	Based on the students data there really wasnt any difference in the animals stretched. The students could have put more weights on they even could have extends the time hanging to improve the experiment design and / or validing of the results.
4402	2	2	A conclusion can be that plastic types B and D are more strecthable than plastic types A and C. One way they could have improved is by adding the plastics' original length in the graph to help show that they did strecth. Another way is to have include the weight of the weights so that it can be duplicated if needed.
4403	2	0	A. Plastic A stretched 2mm, plastic B stretched 1mm, plastic C stretch 1mm and plastic D didn't stretch. ^p B. The student could have done this over distinct results . The student could have also checked his work more frequently to see exactly how long it took for each of the pieces of plastic to lower.
4404	2	2	a. As you can see, plastic B could stretch longer than any plastic. Plastic D had similar results for both trials. Plastic A was the only plastic that was able to not stretch that far.^p b. What this student should do to improve his experiment is to run more trials and to add what he is comparing to.
4405	2	3	Based on the information provided from the experiment, I conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability (22mm, 23m) and plastic A is the least stretchability (10mm, 12mm). Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their lab was to cut the same length of each plastic prior to testing stretchability and to specify the amount and mass at the weights to added.
4406	2	1	My conclusion is that the plastic that can stretch more is plastic B because it has the longest accounted stretched in mm, and other plastics do not stretch longer than plastic B.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by putting one set of weights in T1 and another st of weights in T2. Also they could have improved by letting it hang for more time to see if they can resist.
4407	2	3	a) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most flexible and plastic A is the least. ^p b) The student needs to perform at least 3 trials with each plastic for it to be valid also, the student set a length at which plastic should initially be. This will improve validity as well.
4408	2	1	My conclusion is that the type of plastics similar to strength because none of them had a huge difference, but type B and D are closer to farthest one is 23, the other 22 is now A and C are closer one is 12 the other 13. And type D stayed the same during both trials. Plus a way to improve this experiment would be have more trials because there wasn't that many data to compare and the ones they had wasn't relly of a difference.
4409	2	2	a) Based on the students data plastic type B streched the most out of any other type of plastic. b) To improve the experiment the students could have increased the amount of time they would allow the pieces to strech further and another plastic could end up streching further, all the plastic may have needed was more time. To improve the validity of the results the students should have included the plastics orginal length in the table.
4410	2	2	a) As you guys can see the sample of plastic B was the most strechable plastic out of all of them, the plastic B streched the most in both trials.^p b) 1 ways that the student could of changed the experiment by labeling the plastics that he used. 2 He also could of changed the weight of the clamp.3) He could of also added another try to make sure that witch is the most strechable plastic.
4411	2	2	Based upon the data plastic type B, stretches the most. The student could have had a designated amount of weight for adding to the clamps. The student also should have put step 7 before step 6 to make, things go along more smoothly.
4412	2	3	A) a conclusion of this experiment is type B stretched the most, it Stretched an average of 22.5mm, this was greater then type D with an Average of 20mmtpe C with 13.5mm and lastly A with 11mm. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved their experiment design/validity is specify if the same amount of weight is being added and have 3trials to make sure numbers are accurate.
4413	2	1	Plastic type B held 22mm on the first trial and 23mm on the second trial. So plastic type B held the most mm in both trials. The only plastic close to it was plastic type D which had 20mm in trail 1 and 20mm in trial 2. Since plastic type B held B held more in both trials, then plastic type B is the can hold the most. The way the students could have improved their experiment is by having more trials. This would have improved the validity of their results. Another way is by making it longer than 5 minutes to let the plastics hang, because it might leave longer stretch much.
4414	2	2	A) It seems like plastic B has the most stretch ability because it stretched 22 mm in T1 and 23 T2. ^p B) To improve the experimental assign the students could have kept the amount of weight they carried to the bag constant and they could have kept the weights for another five minutes and measured it again afterwards.
4415	2	2	In the second trail two plastics, A and B, stretched out more unlike 2 and B, C stretched less the second time while D stayed the same. One way the student could have improved his experiment is by doing it a third time to see which of the highest two were right. A second would be showing the length of the plastics when the student first started.
4416	2	1	A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type A is the strongest because T1 only stretched 10mm and T2 only stretched 12mm. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by naming the types of plastics that a used and by adding a control to the experimental design.
4417	2	1	A) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that A was the weakest and C was the most ourable are ^p B) one wagt that it can be improved is to explain how C was unstretched. Another way for improvement was have more trials to see what happens to each of the plastics.
4418	2	0	A) My conclusion for this experiment is that Trial 2 is going to get the most stretchability  for the plastic type. ^p B) The plastic sample doesn't have to hang freely down the side of a table and before  you perform the second trial just like the first, add on additional 5-10 minutes to the procedure.
4419	2	2	In this expierement we have learned that all bags tend to stretch when carrying weights. In this expierement, plastic type A proved to be the least stretchiest while plastic type  proved to be stretched the most. ^P The students could have said how many weights to be add or how heavy they total up to be. ^P The students could have also said what type of plastics they used so we can test it our selves.
4420	2	2	Based on the students data the conclusion that plastic B has the most stretchability because it has the highest length in millimeters after the experiment. Two things the students could have done to improve the experimental design and validity of the results would be holding the variables more controll. For example set the length of each plastic next if they had a set amount of weight, the results would have come out more valid.
4421	2	1	The students had 4 types of plastic A, B, C, D. They wanted to see which one would stretch the most. They held 2 trials and B came out to be the stretches ist out of them all with a 22, 23 mm
4422	2	2	Based off of the data, plastic type D had the longest stretchability while plastic type A had the least. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be better perform more trials, or make sure that the weight applied to each plastic was the same.
4423	2	1	A - In the second trial plastic type A and B both had more mm but plastic type C in the first trial there was more and with plastic type D it was the same  for both trials.B-They could repeat trials, and use more different type of plastics.
4424	2	2	a.) The order of plastics, from most to least stretchy, is B, D, C then A, where A is the stretchiest and B the least. The overall stretchings of the plastics remained mostly the same from T2 to T2. ^p b.) Taping the plastic a specific distance in from the table edge and adding identical and specified amounts of weight to each plastic would improve the validity, especially when working with such small length chances.
4425	2	0	a) Based on the students data the plastic don't stretches a lot much type 1 and type 2 are almost the same and dont have a much difference.^p b)
4426	2	3	A) Based on the data, plastic B stretched the most out of the four plastics. ^p B) One way to improve the experiment is to specify how much the weights weigh (4). Another way is to set a specific length pf plastic, not just any measure the length (1).
4427	2	2	A. Based on the resluts, plastic type b was the best with the longest (mm) stretched in both trials, 22,23. Then type d with 20mm in both trials then c with 14mm, 13mm. Finally type A with 10mm, 12mm. ^p B. Two ways that the students could improve their validity are 1. do more trials and 2. use more types of plastics.
4428	2	2	a.) Based on the students data from this experiment, plastic type B had the greatest stretchability out of all four plastics. ^p To be more accurate with the validity of their results would be to make sure the length of all the samples in both trials were equal for all types. Another way to improve i he experiment would be to increase the weights in the second trial by  doubling them, and then sampling the data from the two trials.
4429	2	3	a) Plastic B can stretch the longest where as Plastic A can not stretch as far. ^p  b) One way to improve the experiment would be to specify a specific number and type of weights that are being added and to keep it constant. Also, another few trials would prove its validity because there could be human errors, and more trials would lead to more accurate data.
4430	2	2	Based on the experiment, the best plastic based on stretchability would be plastic B. It stretched 22 and 23 mm, which is the most out of all the plastics. Plastic D would also be good, stretching 20 mm, plastic A and C were not so good stretching 10, 12 and it 13 respectively. One way the students could improve their experiment is to add a third trial (B). This would allow for better results because its experiment is being done 3 trials and an average could be made. Another improvement would be to add different weights to see how far each plastic will stretch.
4431	2	1	1) The most stretchable plastic with the most tensile strength, is plastic D, because during both trials it stretched further than all the other plastics.^p 2) a) They could have formulated a hypothesis so that their experiment would have become more guided.b)They could have made sure that each plastic (before stretching) was the same length.
4432	2	0	A) Based on the students data, my conclusion to this is that plastic type D would be the most stretchable, because for both trials, the mm of the length was still the same. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by telling the differences of the two trials, and also did a different polymer plastic have an effect on how it would stretch.
4433	2	2	a) This experiment on polymers turned out to work perfectly without any weird results. For example in this experiment plastic/ polymer B performed the best because in trial one it stretched about 22mm and in trial two it increased flexibility by stretching 23mm. While on the other hand plastic /polymer A experiment the worst because in trial one it only stretched about 4mm and in trial two it only increased its flexibility to 12mm. ^p B)Two ways that those students could have improved this experiment is  by naming the plastic in which they tested and also they should have measured how heavy the weights are to get a more set on judgement , more trials, more attempts & more accurate results.
4434	2	2	Based on the data plastic A had the most significant growth in Amount streched with streching 2 mm faster than it's original trial therefore this polymer has the most streachability. ^p The student could of had an control, also same amount of weights, and did more trials.
4435	2	2	The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the farthest with 22m in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would to make sure that the amount of tape they put on the plastic was equal and how far they taped the plastic on the table.
4436	2	3	The student could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results. They could have done so, by giving a measurement of how far the plastic will hang off from the table. Having the plasics at different lengths hanging from the table will cause error. Also she could say how heavy of weights will be hanging, and for how long. All of these factors affected the experiment.
4437	2	3	This experiment concluded that plastic type A is the least stretchable land plastic type B the most stretchable. Plastic C is also not that stretchable and D is stretchable. One way to add validity to the results is to make sure all of the weights are the same weight. Also that the original plastics are all the same length.
4438	2	1	My conclusion is that plastic type B was the plastic that streched the most. Also in trial two (T2) all the plastic streched more except for plastic type C. The student could have improved by making his hypothesis clearer. He also could of given us the names of the plastics.
4439	2	3	Plastic type B was stretched out the most. The students could have improved the experimental design by calculating the two trials and making the total amount the plastics were stretched. They also could have put down the length of the plastic befor they started streching.
4440	2	2	Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all the polymer plastic. The students could have improved the experiment by testing more specific in their procedure. The length of the tapes should be the same for all the plastics as it was not mentioned. The weight of the weights was not given as it does affect the result in the amount stretched. The student could have also mentioned the name of the polymers to make the data table more specific and the experiment more useful to others.
4441	2	2	a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest . Even though A C and D did not have very different results, B stretched the most. Also plastic D remained constant both trials. ^p B) One way the student could have improved was to make more trials. Two trials can not give the best results. Also, they could have lengthened the time and put heavier weights on the clamps.
4442	2	1	A) The results that were given showed that type A was the least stretchiest type C had the second least stretch, type D was the second stretchiest and finally type D could stretch the most. ^p The student could have improved this experiment is by showing how long they stretched the plastic till it broke, and add a control to the experiment so they could compare the results to a regular stretched plastic.
4443	2	3	A) The conclusion of this experiment is that polymer B has the most stretchability, while polymer A is the least stretchable. ^p B) The students could have improved there experiment version by stating the amount of weight used to stretch each polymer so if further study is needed the experiment can be replicated and to add more trials to confirm the data.
4444	2	3	a) Plastic B has the greakest amant of stretchability, surpassing the next stretchiest by 2-3 mm. ^p b) The students, in order to improve validity, must record the length of each sample prior to stretching, to observe change. Also, they should acknowledge the amount of weight used to stretch the plastics, and never change it.
4445	2	3	"a) The conclusion I'd draw from the student's data would be that plastic type ""B"" was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve his experimental design, the student could've specified how heavy the weights could be so that anyone replicating his work would know. To improve his results validity, he could have done more than 2 trials-the more trials he did, the more valid his results would be."
4446	2	3	(a) Plastic type A stretched the least and is therefore the most durable of the 4 types. ^p (b) The students could improve the experimental design by determining a consistent starting area for all of plastics, and they could improve the validity by doing more trials.
4447	2	1	This student's data proves that plastic D had the greatest stretchability. stretching, 20 mm after 5 minutes. The least stretchable type of plastic was plastic A which only stretched 10mm in the first trial and 12 mm in the second. A way the student could have improved the experiment is they should have used a more firm material than tape such as stables or tieing it. Another way to improve is to allow the trials to each stand for 10 minutes to receive greater results.
4448	2	3	My conclusion to this polymer investigate is that plastics type B has the most stretchability. I think this because trial 1 and trials 2 both have the most stretchability. Some ways that the experiment could have been improved is by taking the I cader how much. The weights and clamp weighed. Another way the the experiment could he improved is by telling the reader where the clamp was placed.
4449	2	3	a) Plastic B was the stretched of all the polymeres. Plastic A was the strongest of all the polymers. ^P b) This person should have the exact length of the plastic. He/she also should have told the exact amount of weight to add to the clamp.
4450	2	0	To my conclusion it looks like one second trial almost every plastic type stretched more than the first time because it was already stretened from the first trial also think the thanken and the plastic the less it stretened. two ways to improve the experiment is time it longer to see the difference and use a different piece of plaste for each trial.
4451	2	2	In conclusion plastic type B stretched out the longest in both trials and most of the others were far behind it. Two ways I would improve the design is to say how much weight I am adding at a time and attach two clamps on the bottom to even out the weight so it didn't rip through the middle.
4452	2	2	A) All plastics stretched but D making D the most durable plastic. ^p B). Add more trials which would improve the data. ^p Instead of the weights being on for 5 minutes having them on for 10 would show long term effect. ^p use the same clamp for for all plastics.
4453	2	0	They could have used beacher holder and tape the plastic to the beaker holder and let it hold freely.They could get more results for different trials.
4454	2	2	The data shaved that plastic A stretched the most compared to the other plastics. Plastic A stretch 2mm, plastic B stretch 1mm, plastic C decreased 1mm in trial 2 and plastic D stayed the same. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results is to include the starting length of each plastic in the results to better understand how much each plastic stretched. Secondly for trial 2 I think the student should have added more weights and added a trial 3 with more weights for more results.
4455	2	3	Based on the student's data I can see that plastic type B had the Most stretchability because both trials it stretched the most. To make this more valid, the student should have used the same length to start with for each plastic. Also they should include how many weights should be added and have much each weight weighs in order to keep it constant.
4456	2	3	A) Plastic type B will Sstrech the most, while plastic A will strech the least. B) describe the initial lenht of each plastic, and describe the amount of weight added to the clamp.
4457	2	2	A conclusion that can be drawn from their data is that plastic type B has the most elastic compared to A,C, and D. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment and made it more valid would be to do another trial and let us know where each of the plastics start lengths were.
4458	2	0	Plastic A and B stretched, cup C Di stretched whe mm and plastic D stayed the same. This experiment could be just proved by using be4tter plastic or living the weights in longer.
4459	2	3	3.a) They found that plastic type B has the exact stretchability because it stretched more than any of the other polymers. ^p b) The could improve the validity of the experiment by doing more trials. They could included the size and wight of the wights which would in tus a improve the design or the experiment.
4460	2	3	a) Plastic B stretched the most at av average at 22.5 mm plastic A only stretched an average of 11mm, which is the least out of all of the plastics tested. b)  One way the students could have improved their experiment would be to say how much weight they are pouring onto the clamp. Another thing they should have done would be to beep all of the plastics taped to a table at the same height. It does not say they are all held at the same height in the procedure, so we cannot assume they were.
4461	2	3	Base on the student's data, plastic type B is the most stretchy, and type A doesn't stretch as far. ^P 2 ways the students could have improved was do a 3rd trial for more comparing results. Another way would be have the same amount of weights for each type.
4462	2	2	a) A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is that the plastic A stretched less in each trial from any other plastic T. it was 10 and T2  it was 12mm. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by first telling us how many weights C how heavy they should be. The second way is by doing more trials.
4463	2	3	In conclusion, each one of the plastics are different types of plastic due to the understanding of the chart which clearly proves that each plastic is different due to the different amounts and lengths they were stretched. The student could have improved the experiment by adding more test trials to see if the data is perfectly correct and by making sure the amount of weights added on the claps were equal.
4464	2	1	The examples came out pretty accurate to the chart and procedure. ^p But they needed to improve possibly by doing longer trials or adding how much weight if someone gave me this procedure I would not be able to perform it.
4465	2	3	A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that the plastic that  can be stretched the most is type B, and the one which can be stretched the least is type A. The students could have improved this design by keeping or consistent sample size. Another way this experiment could have been more valid as if the weights on the plastic were also kept consistent.
4466	2	2	A) Based on the data we found is that plastic B was the plastic that had stretched the most and plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the student could have improved there experimental design is to be more exact on the amount of weight used, Alsocould of shortend the time.
4467	2	1	As a result of our testing type b stretched the most out of all the other plastic type. ^p One way the stretches could have improved there testing could be to.
4468	2	3	(A) A conclusion cannot be made with the amount of data given, the experiment doesn't show the starting size of each plastic same so the data given doesn't show how much each some stretched. (B) To improve this experiment the students must record, and keep constant the size of each plastic sample. Another way to improve the validity of this experiment is to record, and keep constant the amount of weight added to each of the plastic samples.
4469	2	3	a) As you can see in my table that plastic B was the most stretched plastic and the none least stretched was plastic A.^p B) I think the students could of told how much each weight really whey. Another thing was how far could each plastic go and how much space was the weight and plastic from each other.
4470	2	0	One way they could of improved this experiment.
4471	2	1	My conclusion is in the second trial (T2). Each plastic sample stretched longer than it did in the first trial (T1). Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is they should have told us how each longnt pound's did the nitach anlo the clamps instead of taking one sample of plastic take 3 or 4 samples.
4472	2	2	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic A and B are both equally stretchy. They both increased by one mm long. I can also conclude that plastic D is not stretchy because through out both trails it stayed at 20mm. One way the student could have improved the experiment would be to make all the plastics the same length at the beggining so the results are more valid and clear. They also could have been specific about how much weight to be added. Another thing they could add is a controll
4473	2	0	The conclusion of this evestigation is that the plastic types did not stretch much. Type D didn't even phase B. The kould have told us what kind of plastic did they use. And what are you using to measure the plastic types?
4474	2	1	a)According to the data, plastic type D is the strongest because it stretched 20 mm in both trials. Therefore, it has the greatest stretchability.^p (b)The experiment could have been improved by ensuring that all the plastics one being clamped with the same amount of weights. It would also be a good idea to use a control, without the use of weights. This way, it would be easier to improve the end results with the control and variable.
4475	2	0	The polymer plastics all had different results after each trial was tested. Plastic type A and B both had an increase in length after trial 2. Plastic type C had a negative effect by going down a mm, and D stayed the same. The student could have used different time periods, or even tested the durability of the plastic after it was tested.
4476	2	3	Plastic type B stretched the farthest.^p The student could have improved the experimental design by recording the exact weight to clamp. They also could have put the measurements of the plastic before it was stretched.
4477	2	3	The conclusion I can draw from the data is plastic B is the most stretchabety. The data show in trial one it stretched to 22mm and trial two it stretched 23mm while D only stretched 20mm. ^p Two way the student could improve the experiment is do more trial and tell us how much weights to put on.
4478	2	1	The student got different results. He got A-B lower higher and C-D higher lower. ^p Two ways he could have improved his experimental design was by doing it over.
4479	2	0	None of the plastic really seemed to move that well maybe except millimeters which in all reality isnt much.
4480	2	2	a.) I conclude that plastic type B has the most ability to stretch because it stretched the most in both of the trials. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved on the experiment design and validity and to use a control and add more trials.
4481	2	2	A. The most stretchable plastic would be plastic type B. ^P B. First off the students have to make sure the plastics are all the same length to begin with. Second their data table should've shown what they started out with.
4482	2	3	a) Plastic type B stretched the most then type D, then type c, and type A streched the least. ^p b) One way they could have improved would be making the weight constant. The results would also be more valid if it was done a 3rd time.
4483	2	2	Plastic type B stretched the most and type A stretched the least. I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchy. Because of the lack of information it is hard to to conclude anything. Two ways they could have improved would be to specify how long each plastic start, as and what your measuring, how much it stretched or how long it is total after being stretched.
4484	2	0	In conclusion all the plastics bear up at one except plastic type D that stoped the same length. They would of told the types of plastics they were using because most plastics react different with clamps or weigh on. Also, give before descriptions on procedures.
4485	2	0	Plastic type 'A' and 'B' stretched more in the second trial as compared to 'C' which decreased by 1mm and 'D' which stayed the same. ^p (B) Maybe to show some difference the student could have used different weights, or the same weight but left if on for different times.
4486	2	0	I think the student the student should draw a conclusion based on the data he/she has.
4487	2	0	Plastic type D stretched the furthest and plastic type A stretched the lowest. The student could've listed the diffrent types  of plastics used and explain the procedure better.
4488	2	2	A) The plastic type D has the most resistance out of the group and type A has the least amount. ^p B) The student should've measured before stretching is to make, control. Then the students should've done the least one more trial.
4489	2	2	(A) Plastic type B stretched longer than type A, C, and D plastics. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to add make we4ight to the second trial and have tie plastic hang longer.
4490	2	2	From the students data, you can conclude that plastic type A the most stretchable. You can conclude this because all other types had either1 mm length change, or no change but type A had a change of 2 mm . Two ways the student could have improved would  have been to have more trials for each type to make sure findings were acurate, and to say the amount of weight added onto the plastic samples in his procedure.
4491	2	2	The conclusion that I drew was that plastic type B stretched the furthest, Two ways that the students could of improve there experiment is that they could of did the experiment a third time, or probaly let the weights hang on the plastic for more than 5 minutes.
6809	3	1	As described in the article, pandas eat an abundance of bamboo and therefore are specialist to China, while the koala ''eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.'' Both these animals are specialists to one habitat while the python, a generalist is able to live in a wider range of habitats virtually anywhere.
6812	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar because they both need a certain food that they eat such as bamboo and eucalyptus leaves but a python will not eat anything but it needs in certain climate to be able to live there.
6813	3	1	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia eat only bamboo and eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively according to the author. For this reason, they are both specialists. However a the article states a python is a generalist and able to inhabit a number of different locations around the world, unlike the Panda and Koala who are limited to their native countries.
6814	3	1	Pandas are similar to koalas because they are both specialists, that must have special surroundings and certain things to eat. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because a python can live almost anywhere with the help of the climate generalist which is a human being as stated in paragraph 20 (Achenbach,5).
6815	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both require specific plants for survival. Pandas need bamboo, and koalas need eucalyptus leaves. Both animals are specialists ( Achenbach par 21). They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists, and they tend to do the best in and around humans (par. 20).
6816	3	1	Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus leaves. This animals are specialist. Pythons are generalist they can survive on almost any thing.
6817	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat one main food source ( pandas bamboo koalas eucalyptus leaves ). So they survive best in one stable , non changing environment. However, pythons can live and adapt to new conditions, so they can move to different environments, such as Asia to Florida.
6818	3	2	Pandas in China almost exclusively eat bamboo making them a specialists species. Koalas in Australia are also specialists because they almost exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves. They are diffrent from pythons because pythons can live almost anywhere and can thrive on almost any food source.
6820	3	0	Panda bears are similar to koala bears because one, they are both a type of bear and two, they eat grass & plants. They are different then pythons because pythons are reptile and they eat things whole.
6821	3	2	In the article the author tells us that China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Australia's koala bear exclusiusvely eats eucalyptus leaves. Both animals really eat one thing. A python is very different it doesnt eat one thing it swallows its meals there for its very different.
6822	3	1	Pandas and koalas are.''specialist'' meaning that they are not as abundant as generalists. A python is a generalist. According to the article, a python can adapt more easily while a koala, fore example, ''eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively.''
6823	3	1	"Pandas & koalas are similar to each other because they are specialists each only eating food that is specific to a custom area of tries globe. But pythons are generalists they eat meat & only require a certain climate for example ""A python swallowed an alligator"" that wouldn't happen in their homeland."
6824	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because panda's only eat bamboo and koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves there and source is not every where they both cant just move from China or Australia because there food is not made every where around the world.
6825	3	1	Panda in China are similar to koalas in Australia because each one needs to stay their own habitat because they cannot live without the sources that their habitat give them. They both are different from pythons caue python could addapt in any environment For example on the paragraph 21, the author give us a reason for why the pandas and koalas can't live in other environment.
6826	3	1	China's panda and Australia's koala are similar in that they basically only consume one type of plant each. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. These two animals are different from pythons because pythons eat other species.
6827	3	1	Pandas and koalas are both the same because they only eat certain things. They are also both specialists. They are different from pythons because they are specialists and pythons are generalists. Pythons have a variety of foods they eat while the pandas and koalas don't.
6829	3	0	As you can see, pandas in China are similar to koalas in Austria because they are both specialist animals. Also, the panda and koala are herbivores, one eats bamboo and the other eats eucalyptus leaves. In addition, both the panda and koala are different from the pythons because they are specialist animals and they are carnivores meat eaters. Therefore, pandas and koalas are actually different from pythons.
6830	3	1	China's panda bears eats almost nothing but bamboo, and Australia's koala bears eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. These bears are different from pythons eat meat sources.
6831	3	0	"Panda & koala are similar because their both a specialist, as a python is a generalist. The article says, ""A generalist is a raccoon, a python,..A specialist is China's panda... or Australias's koala""."
6832	3	1	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are alike because they both are plant eaters. For example in paragraph 21 they say that a panda and koalas are specialist. Pandas and koalas are different than pythons because pythons are carnivor they eat alive things and as I said in paragraph 20 it says pythons are generalists.
6833	3	2	Chinese pandas and Australian koalas are similar because they are both specialist species. They only flourish and survive in a very specific area. For example, pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively. However, pythons are generalist species. They can survive almost anywhere. The article states that the species that have become most abundant are those that do best in and around humans.
6834	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both of them can only live off one food source. They cannot live anywhere else because they need that specific thing found only in their enviorment. Pythons however can live off many things, they can live in different enviorments and eat different rats, thats how they live across the world.
6835	3	1	How pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia is they both eat almost one thing all the time. Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo, and the koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. And how their both different from a python is that they don't eat anything when their hungery , a python will eat what ever animal or human it can get.
6837	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because, they eat basically one thing, plants. The python eats a lot of different kinds of animals and such.
6839	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist and they only eat plants and pythons eat mammals. According to the article, pandas almost only eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves exclusively so that shown that they are nothing like pythons.
6840	3	2	The Chinese panda and Australia's koala are both similar because they both eat special type of food. They are both specialists according to the article. Both the Chinese panda and the australian koala are different than python b/c the python is a generalist that can adapt to different food scources.
6841	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they depend on what the environment brings them (such as bamboo or eucalyptus leaves 'they depend on those sources to be there or they'll have trouble surviving however, pythons are very different because they on there habitats such as were they live & climate changes.
6842	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they can both live off one plant, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. They are both different from pythons because they don't pose any threats like pythons do. You won't find a koala or a panda with a wood rat or an alligator in its mouth like you may a python.
6844	3	1	"Pandas and koalas are quite similar in that both species have adapted immensly to their surroundings in that they would probably become hopeless if one was to be outside of their home and found to adapt elsewhere, They are consicttenca "" specialists"", They differ from pythons in that pythons are "" Generalists"", the ultimate generalist is arguably a human being, can live anywhere that is kashy the orbility of a python."
6845	3	1	Pandas and koalas are both specialist. They also both have exclusive diets. The panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eats just eucalyptus leaves. A python is a reptile and the panda and koalas are mammals. The python is also carnivorous where as the panda and koala are omnivorous.
6847	3	2	"Both koalas (in Australia) and pandas (in China) or ""specialists."" Specialist have a small range of diet, ""China's panda..eats almost nothing but bamboo (and) Australia's koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively are two great examples. Pythons, on the other hand, are generalists, which means they have a greater variety of prey. They are expected to survive better because they don't rely on one single prey."
6852	3	0	Pandas and koalas are similar because thier specialists species who need sertain things to servive. They are not like the pythons because pythons are generalist who can servive in large areas.
6854	3	1	Panda's from China and koala bears from Australia live off a restricted eating habit. China's pandas strictly eat nothing but bamboo, and koala only eats eucalyptus. These types of animals are specialists. A generalist was said that can live anywhere. They adapt easy to there environment, like pythons do.
6856	3	1	The are of the specialists of panda's shows far that wich eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. The reasons for that I think are causes they live they grow what they eat and specialy with what other animals they live.
6857	3	1	Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both a type of bear for one and they only eat one thing. In the article they were compared because they only eat one type of food. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They differ from python because pythons eat many different things. Also, pythons are reptiles while bears are mammals.
6859	3	1	"Pandas in China and koalas are similar because they both specialists. They each eat on specific food and do well in a stable environment. Pythons are different from both the panda and the koala because they only are generalists; they can survive in a number of environments and ""do best in and around humans."""
6861	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they both eat mainly one thing. Pandas eat mostly bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Unlike these animals, snakes eat a variety of things. Snakes mostly eat other animals of living things.
6863	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they only eat one type of food which is bamboo for pandas and eucalyptus leaves for koalas. While pythons are able to eat many types of foods and adapt to other sources.
6864	3	1	"Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are both specialists, which the article defines as anything that needs stability. The article also says that "" a generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white inland deer"". They are able to like humans live in man other places and thrive of a many different things."
6866	3	1	Pandas in China are animals that only eat bamboo and koalas in Australia only eat eucalyptus leaves. They are both similar because they both rely on 1 food source. Pythons eat all kinds of rodants and pandas and koala bears rely on 1 food source.
6869	3	0	"Pandas from china are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. ""A specalist is china's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo or Australia 's koalas bear which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exlusively"" .They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists."
6870	3	1	Pandas in china and koalas in Australia are both specialists,they can only survive in a stable environment as they survive on certain plants(food),live bamboo and eucalyptus leaves and needs certain climate.Pythons are generalists which can survive in a rapidly changing environment on multiple foods and climates.According to the article a generalists can live anywhere from Florida to Antarctica (or other species). A specialist can be a panda eats almost nothing but bamboo.
6871	3	2	As it says in paragraph 21, both the panda and koalas are specialists which means that they both need a certain thing to keep them alive. Pythons on the other hand need a varied climate to adapt quickly to add food sources. This means generalists, like pythons, will throw out specialists because they evolve better.
6873	3	0	China panda eat nothing but bamboo, and Australia's koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves.
6875	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They only eat one kind of food which is only in the place that they are native to. They both are different from a python because the python can eat any kind of animal. o if they bad to survive in different places they could because they would have food there.
6876	3	0	Koalas in china are similar to koalas in Australia  because both of these animals are know in their country .Both theese animals have repulation in their country.They are boith different from the python  because pythons arn't know to be a specific country they are all over the world.
6877	3	1	Pandas and koalas are similar by the fact that they are categorical as generalists. Each animal are specifically affected to the food in their country, such as the panda in China eats almost nothing but bamboo and the koala eats exclusively eucalyptus leaves.
6878	3	0	"In the story ""one man's pet, another's invasive species,"" Pandas in china eat almost nothing but bamboo or Australias koala bears, eat eucalyptus. They both different because pandas and koalas are similar to a bear and pythons are snakes."
6880	3	2	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist and have mainly one food source. Pandas and koalas are different from pythons because unlike pandas and koalas, pythons have a vast variety of food they can eat and they can live anywhere that has the similar climate as asia.
6883	3	2	pandas in china are similar to pandas in Australia because they are both specialists. paragraph 21 states that both the species live off of are food, bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. They are different from the python because a python is a generalist, which can adopt to anywhere. Pandas and koalas have to stay in the place to survive.
6884	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists, and this age favors generalists, like humans, more. They differ from pythons because pythons are generalists, change favors generalists while stability favors specialists, so we are favoring change, which means generalists.
6885	3	1	Pandas in China are very alike to koalas in Australia because each of these animals eat only one kind of plant. Pandas eat bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. These two were also considered specialists in the article. While the pythons were considered generalists for being in different. A python, for example  could any thing it's way.
6886	3	2	Pandas are similar to koalas because they both only eat on food source. Pandas only eat bamboo and koalas only eat eucalyptus. They are different from the python because if they were to move from there homeland they would survive on varieties of food but pandas and koalas can't do that.
6887	3	1	Pandas and koalas are alike in that they are both specialists because they eat only their on many food source. Panda eat mostly bamboo, am koalas almost always eat eucalyptus leaves. They differ from pythons because pythons  can eat a wide variety of things from different habitats.
6888	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia is because they both almost eat nothing but bamboo and eucalyptus. But python is different from pandas and Australia because it eats alligatar and swallowed.
6889	3	2	Pandas and Koalas can only survive where the plants they eat are, because they won't eat anything else. Pythons can live and thrive in other places because they eat a wide range of animals and survive in a larger climate/environmental range. Pandas/Koalas are specialists, while pythons and humans are generalists.
6890	3	1	"Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialist species. China's panda eats nothing but eucalyptus leaves. These species differ from pythons because pythons are generalists and according to the article can survive anywhere from ""California to Delaware and including much of the south."""
6891	3	1	The pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia. In the article it say they eat nothing but bamboo and eucalyptus leaves. And they both are, different from pythons because pythons eat meat and the pandas and koalas don't.
6894	3	0	Pandas in China eats bamboo and koalas eats eucalyptus leaves and both are found in trees. Both Pandas and Koalas are different from pythons because unlike pandas and koalas, snakes can sometimes be found in tree and in the article it says a python ate an alligator.
6896	3	1	Pandas and koalas are the same type of animal because that spiecies stays in one are of the worl because thats the only place it will survive. Opposed to the pythons which is able to live anywhere and can adapt with hep from mabum day lan zology.
6897	3	1	China's panda which eats almost nothing but bamboo. Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively unlike pythons, which eats everything in one where and leaves nothing of it left behind.
6898	3	2	Pandas are like koalas because the both only eat one thing. Both are also in trouble should their environment change rapidly. They are different from a python because they aren't adaptive. For example, a python can be taken from Asia and moved to America and adapt quickly an easily. If the same was done to the panda or koala it would starve to death.
6899	3	1	The panda bear is similar to the koala because they both eat only one type of food. For a panda it's bamboo and for koala's its eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because a python eats animals and the bears eat vegitatian.
6902	3	1	Pandas in China are similar from koalas in Australia because they are both are harbavores. Also, as stated in paragraph 21 they are specialists and only eat about one type of food. A python on the other hand is a generalist  and eats many different things like meat. Over all, a koala or a panda are very picky and a python is not
6903	3	0	How panda's in China are similar to Koalas in Australia is they are bears, and they both almost eat the same things, they both can clime trees: the eat leaves, and fruit. They both are diffrent from pythons because they are not a reptile also they can not fit the same amount in there mouth in one bite like a python. they don't eat most of what pythons eat and also they do not shed there skin/scales.
6904	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because panda bears eat bamboo leaves almost all the time and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. Panda bears and koala bears are different from pythons because pythons in Asia inhabit climates that are similar to those in about a third of the continental U.S, while panda bears live in China and koala bears live in Australia.
6905	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia by the fact that they both eat almost nothing and they are both animals that do not harm anyone. A python is very different from both of these animals because pythons are very dangerous and can kill something larger than itself.
6906	3	1	Panda's and koala's are similar because they both only consume one type of food daily. These two animals differ from pythons because pythons are invasive species and kaola bears and pandas are not. Also because pythons have a wide variety of food that they eat and pandas and koala bears only have one type of food in their diets.
6908	3	2	The panda's and koalas are similar because they are specialists. The article states that both species only eat one type of plant. This shows how they cannot relocate as easily as the python. The python can eat a large variety of food as states in the article. Because of this it can relocate  much easier than the panda or koala.
6912	3	2	Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are both specialists. Pythons are generalists. Pythons can live anywhere and Pandas and Koalas can only live in one place. Pandas eat bamboo in China, koalas eat only eucalyptus leaves in Australia.
6913	3	1	According to the article, the pandas in China are similar to the koalas in Australia because they are both specialists species. They can only be found living in certain areas and haven't invaded other other areas yet comparing to the pythons a generalist species, they can't adapt to new places like the python can.
6914	3	0	Pandas in China are similar to Koalas in Australia because of the fact that they're both categorized as specialists that can never leave the environment because the only eat plants .They're different from pythons because pythons are known as a generalists that will attempt to Kill any other animals it can. Pythons are known to be extremely harmful and dangerous than amount animals such as the panda Koala bears as well as the the fact that they would spread faster.
6915	3	2	Pandas and Koalas are both specialists. A panda eats almost exclusively bamboo and Koala eats almost nothing else than eucalyptus leaves. Pythons are generalists.They can adapt very quickly. They eat a lot of things ranging from mice to something as big as an alligator.
6916	3	1	China's panda mostly eat just one thing, bamboo. Australia's koalas mostly just eats eucalyptus leaves. Manily, they can only live there because of their food supply. Pythons, with the light technology can live almost anywhere. Pythons are generalist which gives them the assistance to live anywhere. Pandas & koalas are generalist which makes them have to stay in a certain area to survive.
6917	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist. Both species eat only one thing. A panda only eats bamboo and a koala only eats eucalyptus leaves. They are different from pythons because pythons are generalists and pandas and koalas are specialists.
6918	3	2	"Panda in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they're both specialist species.In the article it says pandas ""eat almost nothing but bamboo"" (Achenbach).Indicating they could live almost nowhere else while pythons are generalist,meaning they can adapt and live in many climates regions."
6919	3	1	"Pandas in China and Koalas bears in Australia are much different then the python. Pandas and Koalas eat very specific foods. ""China panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo,,Koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves exclusively"" (21). The pythons eat many different animals."
6924	3	0	There both a form of bear, and live where there from. A snake is a reptile and can't survive in all of the U.S.
6928	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are herbivoures. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. In contrast, pythons are carnivors, like the article said, a python swallowed an alligator. Therefore pythons are much more dangerous than pandas and koalas.
6930	3	1	In the story it states that both panda and koala live in trees and eat the leaves. There both different from the python because in the passage it says the snake eat things like alligators.
6932	3	2	The article explains how pandas in China eat mostly bamboo, and how koalas eat mostly eucalyptus leaves. These speces have very exclusive diets while the pythons eat very different foods, and potentially other animals. An example would be when a key harse wood rat was tracked into the stomach of a python.
6933	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because both animals have a very specific diet. They are both different from pythons because a python is a reptile. Also, as stated in paragraph 14, a python swallowed an alligator, so the pythons diet is more spontaneous and unpredictable as oppose to the Chinese panda and Australian koala.

10321	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that the article is talking about reptiles and snakes invading new habitats and disrupting the environment. Because of these invasive species, many species are becoming endangered."
10325	4	0	Invasive, probably means something extreme of dangerous  because this article is talking about extreme and dangerous things.
10332	4	1	"Mac Innes think that inasive is an unfair word. ""Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said. They're introduced. I think that inasive is passing judgement."" Inasive is a word towards the reptiles."
10333	4	0	The significance of the word invasive is another word for vishous.
10335	4	0	The article is talking about typical pets such as fish, cats, dogs, vs invasive. Invasive is basically saying animals that normally aren't supposed to be kept as pets, or are rarely kept such as snakes, and other reptillas.
10337	4	0	Invasive - means not introduced, its a big part of the article because pythons,lizards,reptiles are not known to be pets buts scientist are trying to make it to people have them as pets.
10338	4	0	Invasive means mean and angry, because he says ''even the term invasive species is unfair,'' & in the article he is talking about how reptiles and pythons aren't that mean & vaguar.
10339	4	0	"From Reading this article I think the ward invasive means ""unknown"" The significance of this word to the article is that to some people these reptiles are unknown and questions, but on the other hand some of the reptiles are people pets. So that doesn't mean that these creatures are ""invasive"" to everyone."
10340	4	1	They are scared that vicious animals are spreading and killing off other species. But the significance is that they will multiply.
10343	4	0	The significance of the word ''invasive ''to the rest of the article is that the reptiles are dangerous since they came from a wild habitat but is not a fair word to describe them. ''Even the term invasive is unfair.''
10344	4	0	I think they used the word invasive as a judgmet to their work, they're trying to critises.
10346	4	0	The significance of the word invasive to this story is big because it's all about how many places and how they got invade by different reptiles and how can one become one of them.
10347	4	2	"The word ""invasive"" is very significant to the rest of the article. In this article invasive describe the animals like the python who have been introduced to new land and take over. They have eaten many of the animals that were their privously and their kind has become dominate in an area which they were not originally from. Scientists call these animals ""invasive"" to describe their doing."
10348	4	1	In this article invasive is used to describe that the reptiles are being brought somewhere they don't really belong and in some places are slowly starting to take over or at least harm the wildlife. Although Rooroy MacInnes believes he is simply ''introducing'' after the problems the reptiles cause they definatly are invasive.
10349	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article is that the inclusive animals were brought to unnatural locations, either by storms or by people. The article says that the animals are ""introduced"" to new environments rather than the animals invading a new location."
10351	4	1	''Invasive is important to the article because people have different views on the use of this word. MacInnes says that ''invasive'' is a passing judgement. This means he thinks that ''invasive'' is the wrong word to use, on the other hand  Skip Snow thinks that MacInnes's argument is ''ridiculous.'' He's saying that ''invasive'' is the perfect word to use.
10353	4	1	"The article says ""Unchecked by natural predators, invasive species are major threats to biodiversity"". So when people hear the phrase ""invasive species"" they get scarred. The article provides an arguement on why they shouldn't be, but also why the should."
10354	4	0	"There is a very distinct significance to the word ""invasion"" in this article. The word ""invasion"" in this article means when an animal is brought into a country or accidentely brought into a coutry. Either way its invading the new area."
10355	4	0	The only reason the word invasive describes what is happening is because we don't want them.
10358	4	1	"Many people are the word invasive to describe reptiles people who like python see invasive as a very judgement and negative word "".Even the term invasive species is unfair, he said there introduced. I think that 'invasive' is a passing judgement."
10359	4	2	''Invasive'' refers to ''invasive species.'' They are species not native to their environment. Because they usually don't have predators, they are major threats to biodiversity. They are able to compete with and kill native species, depleting their population. In other words ''invasive'' species disrupt their current habitats ecosystem. They are not supposed to belong there. Therefore, they are considered ''invasive.''
10362	4	0	That all reptiles are becomeing house pets now.
10364	4	0	The significance to the word invasive in the article is describing what people saying reptiles are. They are introducing them to a new place in peoples home when they have them as pets.
10365	4	0	Like it says in the article invasive species undergo a lag before multiplying or spreading. Its significant because its telling all about what the snakes do. They do nothing for a little then when they feel its time then start multiplying.
10367	4	0	The word invasive is like dustribing some one praviesy. Some people wouldn't want reptiles in the house as living next to them because what if they get lose.
10368	4	1	The significance of the word ''invasion'' is explained as a bad thing in the article. While some believe that invasion is a best word to say because they think that if the animal can adapt, then they belong there. But some say they're invading because they would chose changes to the environment and to the species that originated.
10370	4	0	The word invasive is used in the article. Pythons are wild lethal reptiles. In the article it says that a hurricane was responsible for invading everywhere. Th chart shows how the pythons invaded from their home in Florida to across the state of  California. This is the significance of word invasive.
10373	4	0	The author explains in paragraph 19 that a python is a generalist and with the help of technology can live anywhere. And in paragraph 21 he explains how koalas and pandas are similar because they are specialists. Koala's exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves and panda just only eat bamboo.
10374	4	1	The word Invasive is significant to rest of the article because it describes how the reptiles have been brought into a new habitat. The article says that they are eating other species of animals and disrupting the environment showing that these reptiles have taken over a new area of the world.
10375	4	0	The significance of the word Invasive to the rest of the article was to prove that invasive species were animals that were very attractive. They were very over populated and had eat blocked somehow.
10376	4	0	"The significance of they word invasive in this article, because they call these reptiles very invasive. Even though they aren't invasive. In paragraph #7 MacInnes says ""Even the ""term invasive species' is unfair."" He believes that they aren't invasive."
10377	4	1	Invasive refers to a species introduced in a large population. Pythons originate in South American countries. When those pythons are introduced to North American environments they are classified as invasive these pythons don't originate in North America and are introduced rather than natively born.
10378	4	2	"Something that is invasive is able to come into a new area and thrive. In the case of this article snakes are invasive because they are ""unchecked by natural predators"" which make them major threats to biodiversity."" Introducing things that are invasive is bad because other animals have not adapted to them being part of their ecosystem."
10379	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in the article is that they feel that pythons are almost all over the country and that some people don't like it. ""They say invasive species are major threat to biodiversity."" They think this animals are dangerous and are talking a lot of space."
10384	4	0	MacInnes contends that the goverment overestimates the treat posed by invasive reptiles. He says he's being blocked by the U.S.

12887	5	1	The process starts out with the mRNA leaving the nucleus. The ribosomes in the cell are what makes the proteins. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome. The tRNA in the cell brings the materials needed to create protein to the mRNA. The tRNA can only get one material. Dehydration synthesis begins to join the parts together, making a protein.
12888	5	1	The mRNa replicates the strand of DNA, making an exact copy of it. Then it leaves the nucleus and is cut into sections of three. Then, they are 'read.' These deciphered mRNA are then changed into amino acids. The amino acids make proteins.
12889	5	1	1) The translation process starts which decodes the mRNA message.2) Then the tRNA tranfers that decoded message of the amino acid sequence.3)Next, the amino acid sequence goes through transcription.4)The protein is assembled on a ribosome.
12890	5	2	1. The mRNA created in the nucleus leaves the nuclear membrane and goes into the cytoplasm. 2. The mRNA is found by a ribosome. The two then lock in with one another. 3. tRNA brings anticodons to the ribosome. The organelle will read the anticodon and match it with the proper codon on the mRNA. This matchup causes a certain amino acid to form. 4. As this proces continues through the entire length of the mRNA, a polypeptide is created.

12895	5	3	After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosomes. It is a single strand, so tRNA comes with its codons that attach to the mRNA in specific ways. It first has to find AUG to start. The rRNA then attaches to the mRNA and creates the site to where the codons can attach to the mRNA and create proteins. As it creates the proteins, the proteins are linked to form a polypeptide chain. The polypeptide breaks loose when it reaches a stop codon.

13251	5	1	First, mRNA receives a copy of the amino acid codon. Then the mRNA transfers that copy and reads the copy. It is then starting the process of making the protein. When the copy has been transfered and read and made, then the protein is made when the stop codon is passed and the process just keeps repeating after that.
13252	5	3	mRNA will exit through the nucleus and travel to possible ribosomes that are nearby. tRNA will come with codons that will now attach themselves to the mRNA in a certain way. It first must seek the AUG which is the start codon. The rRNA will attach to the mRNA and create an area to where the codons can attach to the mRNA and create their own proteins. As proteins are formes, they are linked to form a polypeptide chain. This breaks down loose when reaching of a stop codon occurs.

15999	6	1	One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be that there is a cell membrane which is semi-permeable. Semi-permeable means that only certain things can get into the cell. This type of membrane controls the movement of substances across the cell because certain things cannot get into and then move around in the cell. Another process used by cells would be information transfer where organelles in the cell transport DNA and rNA throughout the cell's system. A third process used by cells is when the lysosome come around and sort of 'clean up' dead organells and recycle them. This affects the cell because then certain organelles are dead and can no longer help the cell or move around in it.

16024	6	2	Osmosis, diffusion, and facilitated diffusion are the three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. In osmosis, it is the movement from higher concentration to lower concentration across a membrane. The soutes are being dissolved in to the solvent and can readily do so on their own. With this there are three types of solutions: hypotonic, hypertonic, and isotonic. In facilitated diffusion, it is movement from higher to lower concntration across the membrane as well with tings that can not readily pass through on their own. These then use the help of thing such as sodium potassium pumps and ion channels. in diffusion, it is also the movement from higher to lower concentration. These things do not need assitance passing through and can readily do this own their own unitl they reach equilibrium, in which all things are balanced and even.

Duffusion is when the cell splits apart into more cells. Endocytosis is when the the the cell need the surrounding layer to form, and when something has to re-enter the cell. For exocytisis, the cell already has the surrounding layer for the substances to move across it, the cell won't let anything else come in.
16054	6	0	Each cell is composed of a membrane with many proteins that allows substances to move across, through the portein. Another process is osmosis.

16078	6	0	One type of process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is facilitated diffusion. This method requires the use of energy to get larger molecules that cannot regularly diffuse across the cell membrane. Another method used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis. Osmosis is the regular diffusion of water or other small particles across the cell membrane without the use of energy. Cells I don't believe can control the movement of substances here. Laslty is diffusion. Diffusion is the movement of particles again that are still small enough as if it was osmosis, but it moves differently. These particles move from low-concentrated areas to high-concentrated areas of particles.

This too, is a type of passive transport. A third example of a process in which a substance is moved across the cell membrane is the sodium-potassium pump.  The sodium-potassium pump transfers 3 sodium ions out of the cell and 2 potassium ions into the cell.  The sodium-potassium pump is an example of active transport.

MRNA is the RNA that uses messenges that are sent from one part of the body to the cell membrane in order to tell the membrane what it is that is needed to be done in the body. TRNA is the RNA that is used to transfer greatly needed data to the cell membrane; however, Ribosomal RNA is used to transfer the needed amount of ribosomes to the cell membrane for more protection for the cell.

16160	6	2	Cells can use osmosis to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Osmosis is when water difuses through a barrier to the other side of it. Diffusion also can be used to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Diffusion is when a substance moves from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration. Transcription can be used, as well, to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Transcription is when a protein is translated and then moved across the cell membrane.

16163	6	0	The cell is surrounded inside by the cytoplasm. That holds all of the organelles together. The second way is to travel through all the organelles one at a time. The final way is when the substance is entering or leaving the cell through the plasma membrane.
16164	6	2	The first type of movement that the cell membrane uses to control the movement of substances is passive transport. This means that the substance being transported will be on the higher side of the concentration gradient and be pushed across the membrane so that both sides will be at a state of equilibrium. The second type is active transport. This means the substance will be pushed against the membrane, from being in a less dense to more dense side. This takes energy from the cell and usually happens at a certain point in the membrane where the substances can bind with a certain type of enzyme.The third type is osmosis. The cell will have to take in water to maintain its functions work properly, and the substances may be in the water that the cell takes in, allowing the substance to cross the cell membrane.
16165	6	2	Cells have a selectively permeanble membrane meaning that they only let certain things into them.  This happens in two ways, osmosis and diffusion.  Osmosis is the crossing of water through the cell membrane and diffusion is the crossing of other things.  One way that a cell allows things into it is active transport.  When a cell has to use active transport, it has to do something to let the object, or liquid, into the cell.  It has to use channel proteins to allow it in.  Another way that cells let things cross through the membrane is through passive transport.  Passive transport is more layed back and happens easier than active transport.

16298	6	1	Cells use simple diffusion to move substances across the membrane.  Simple diffusion involves substances (such as water) located in an area with a high concentration of that substance to move to a location with a lower concentration of said substance.  For example, if there is a high concentration of water inside the cell, and a lower concentration outside the cell, then water will pass through the cell's membrane and go outside the cell.     Cells also use facillitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane.  Facillitated diffusion moves substances from an area of lower concentration to an area of higher concentration.  This type of diffusion requires energy.     Cells also have special transporting proteins in their membranes that help move large substances into and out of the cell.  These types of substances would be too large to pass through the cell membrane just through diffusion.

18804	7	2	Based on the story Rose seems like a very caring person and that she will do whatever it takes to ensure that she helps someone get whatever they want or get anywhere that they want to in life. Rose gives up alot, and lives her life in the situation that she does becuase becuase she knows that is what's best. In her conversation with Anna Rose basicly tells her to keep sticking through it and it'll pay off by reminding her 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for me and you to go to college.'

18806	7	2	Rose is respectful of her relitives feelings because in paragraph 19 it said she didn't answer because if she told the truth it might hurt her aunts feelings
18807	7	2	I think Rose is caring, but she is just too pressured to stay focused and do what she wants to do. You know she cares by her still trying to write a three-thousand-word essay, when she has school, and a job to concentrate on. For her to put that much work in for her family shows she cares a lot about them.
18808	7	2	Rose is overwhelmed with work. She feels what her family is going through and is trying to help but is scared. She has to go to school, then go to work, and on top of that she has to do homework and help take care of her family.

When she was talking to Anna she said that her brother had to go and get a job in Los Angeles becasue it paid three times more. She also said that when Paul finishes college he's going to get a good paying job and that he will pay for thier college.
18813	7	2	Rose seems positive. She said, 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
18814	7	2	Rose is very hopeful. Internally, she may have her doubts about all of her family's struggles, but she suppresses her worries and does what she has to for her family.A good example of this is during her conversation with Anna about how they have their part to do to help Paul finish college so  that he can get a good job and pay for them to go to college.

18823	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Aunt Kolab is that she still has growing up to do. Even though she has a lot of responsibility on her shoulders, she is still young. She still has a lot of learning ahead of her. Rose needs someone to talk to when she has a conflict in her life. You can see this trait in the conversation with Rose and Aunt Kolab.
18824	7	2	Rose is strong-hearted and head strong. She understands that her situations in life are difficult right now having to go to work, make supper, go to school, and do homework, but she keeps her head up and still believes that everything will get better in time.

18830	7	0	She is worried about the responsibility she has to take on. Rose felt too young for so much responsibility.
18831	7	2	I could use many words to describe this young Cambodian girl named Rose she's helpful, caring, smart, gracious, and very reseponsible but I believe that the word that suites her the most is mature.     Rose is very mature, she is handling her situation quite well, she's not going around and complaining about how much she has on her plate she's trying her best to keep a positive view on things. She works a four-hour shift at a restaurant, goes to school and still helps out with household chores like helping her Aunt Kolab prepare dinner.     She's a young adult and has a very high level of maturity for tackling all her tasks and being a strong role model for her younger sister Anna thats why I would describe rose as mature.

18836	7	1	Rose is a responsible young girl. She is also hard-working. One detail from the story that supports this assumption is the following excerpt: 'From school she'd gone straight home to help aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'Rose had a lot of responsibilities that she managed without becoming completely stressed out.
18837	7	2	Rose doesnt like to hurt peoples feeling. You can tell because when her aunt asked if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family she knew how she felt she just didnt want to tell her aunt the truth because she didnt want her to be upset.
18838	7	0	THAT YOU CAN DO ANYTHING YOU WANT IN YOUR LIFE..
18839	7	0	Rose is a very suddle or respectful person because she kept some of her feelings inside of her or didn't tell anyone how she felt fot a while, and no matter what she was bound to keep working to keeep her family good doing whatever it took.
18840	7	1	I can tell from this passage that Rose is a very generous person. Throughout the entire passage, she talks about how she is stressed out and under much pressure, but she keeps doing it all to help Paul get through college. A very specific part to show this is at the very beginning whenever she wakes up from dozing off when trying to do her homework. After that part she talks about why she is tired: because she goes to school, works, and then has to help around her house and try to keep up with homework, and she continues doing all those things to help someone else.

These traits show that Rose tries to be kind even when she is under quite a lot of stress.
18847	7	2	1. Rose is selfless, because she is willing to do something for her family that she does not want to do, and she does not want to let Aunt Kolab know how she feels, because she thinks it might hurt her aunt.

She confesses to her aunt that it is difficult for her to help the family out as much as she does. After she talks with her aunt, Rose feels relieved and lighter.
18852	7	0	Rose could be described as protective. In her conversation with Anna, she insincerely laughs after she states that money isn't everything 'Only if you already have everything,' in order to hide the depth of the family's struggles, as well as the weight upon her own shoulders, from Anna.
18853	7	0	This story is discribing that Rose is letting her work control her attitude. When she talks to Anna, ignores her sister's bad dream.

The story says that she came home from school and went straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift and then straight home to help with supper. She also had to do her homework. Rose was a hardworker and had dedication. She had to have dedication to do school, work, and help out her family. Rose may have had to do all these things, but she did her best at all them to help her family, and to make a better life for her and her family.
18892	7	0	Rose is growing up too fast and having to take on responsibilities that she isn't used to.  She has to act like more of an adult than she really is so that her sister doesn't have to worry.  This is obvious when Anna says 'You sound just like Mama.' It shows that even if rose doesn't realize it, she is becoming an adult.
18893	7	2	One trait the identifies Rose is that she has alot of fate in believe her family will hopefully come out of debt sometime and will not have to worry about money anymore. An example would be when she says that their dad had to go to Los Angoles for a new job so he could get paid more money and some day return, at the same time their brother is going to college and once his finishes and gets a good job, their dad and brother will help pay them two to go off to college.
18894	7	0	She loves money.
18895	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose is trust. She trusts her aunt enough to come to her and tell her whats wrong and it ends up giving her motivational help.
18896	7	2	Rose is a strong induvidual, because she does alot for her family and stays strong for them. An example of this is in paragraph 11 sentences 2 and 3. 'She tried a laugh and that even sounded fake to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college' This shows that Rose is trying to stay strong for Anna and her family by supporting Paul.
18897	7	2	The trait that I would give to Rose during her conversation with Anna is strength, because Rose is also upset about her father being away for four months but she decides not to get discouraged about it.
18898	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose is open minded. Rose spends the whole time stressing about her essay and what she is going to do to support her family. In paragragh 23, Rose became more open minded when she began talking to Aunt Kolab about things she could do to be helpful to the family.
18899	7	1	Rose is very responsible, and she wants her family to stay together. This is talked about in the story when she says That she needs to look at things through other peoples eyes also.
18900	7	2	Rose is caring towards her sister. She gives her sister Anna a logical explanation as to why their father moved for work, rather than complain about how much she misses him too. In a way she is trying to comfort her sister and tell her that it is for the greater good of the family.
18901	7	2	She is caring. She knows that Paul needs to go to college to get a job so that he can pay them back, but Anne just thinks about it now. Although, Anne is right about money isn't everything.
18902	7	0	That she is always worried about her school work and nothing else. When anna told her thath she had a bad dream all rose did was change the subject about the essay.
18903	7	2	Rose is a caring person, and this becomes evident when she askes Anna if shes feeling okay after Anna has had a bad dream.
18904	7	1	helpful
18905	7	0	She wasn't very confident about what was gooing on with the essay and her dad.
18906	7	0	she is shelfish. she only thought about herself and money. maybe we can find a way to do things diferently, a way better for you.
18907	7	2	Hopeful     ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''
18908	7	0	I think that Rose is sympathetic because when she was talking to her Aunt Kolab in the kitchen she doesn't come out and tell her aunt that she feels weighted down by what she does to help the family because she doesn't want to hurt her feelings.
18909	7	2	Rose is a very hard-working young woman. As her aunt had asked her, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Poor Rose has had to work four-hour shifts on top of going to school in order to support her brother through college so that, in return, he can work and support Rose and her sister come time for them to go to college.
18910	7	0	they both dont understand what rose  is trying to say
18911	7	0	stressed- In the 14th paragraph, it says 'She felt too young for so much responsibility', as she cupped her hands together thinking about her life situation.
18912	7	2	One trait that you could give Rose is that she a hardworker, because when she came to the essay and she didn't have anything to write about. She didn't give up or put it off and not do the essay. She continued to try to find a topic to write about.
18913	7	2	Rosa is very motherly. When Anna walks in the room Rosa's first response is to ask, 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' This shows how she cares for her and her family.
18914	7	0	After reading the text, Anna is presented as being tied down, or feeling suffocated. She shows this throughout, but she shows it when she wonders to herself when she would squeeze that essay in(paragraph 3 sentence 1).
18915	7	0	she has too many emotions
18916	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Aunt Kolab is that she is hardworking. She is so hardworking that Aunt Kolab notices it. Aunt Kolab says during their converstion that maybe they can find a way that is better for Rose. One that will take so much stress off of her. This shows that she must work hard for the family to keep it running. It shows that Rose is very hardworking.
18917	7	1	Rose's trait displayed in the story is that she is a very hard worker especially for her family.  When she talks about her day is begins with 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift, then staight home to help Aunt Kelob prepare a quick supper.
18918	7	1	Rose is caring in the way that she does not want to trouble others with her own conflicts.  This is shown when Rose doesn't answer Aunt Kolab when she says Rose feels weighed down by trying help her family.
18919	7	1	That she is responsible, because she helps her sister Anna with her bad dream, even though she didn't appreciate it.
18920	7	2	Rose has a trait of protectiveness. This is shown through her conversation with Anna when she hides her emotions from Anna. This is an example of protectiveness because she is doing what is best for her by not showing that she is scared as well. This will give Anna a sense of comfort to think that someone is in control. Another example is when Anna first walks in and the first thing Rose does is ask if she is ok.
18921	7	2	Rose is a very kind person.  She asks how her sister feels and goes to her room to check on her.
18922	7	1	Rose is perseverent. She doesn't give up. She works a four-hour shift after school and has to do homework too. She knows that she has her families fate in her hands. She knows that she can't give up.
18923	7	0	AN THE ATHOUR IS RIGHT MONEY DOESNT BUY HAPPYNEST
18924	7	1	She is extremely caring of others and does all she can for other people.. She also always puts herself last before others.
18925	7	0	Rose has a trait that makes her seem to herself as helpless.  This is a good trait because you can do more work when you have something that needs done although you do not know why.  You feel helpless and so you do something that needs done without you really even knowing you did it.  Rose is talking to Ana at the time that this trait exposes itself.  It says, She tried a laugh taht sounded fake even to her.  This is trying to get her sister to no feel so bad about Papa leaving to go  to Los Angeles.  She is also trying to get her to know that it is their responsibility to support Paul through college.
18926	7	0	Rose is very stressed because of this essay. She just needed to take her mind off of the essay. In the end she wasn't thinking about the essay and her Aunt helped her firgure out  title by not really even helping her.
18927	7	2	Rose is very determind but she is also being wighed down by other things like the essay she is doing to help her family. She is very determind to get the essay done and help her family and her brother.
18928	7	1	Even though it doesn't say in the story, but you can kind of get a hint that Rose is older than Anna, but also younger than Paul. Paul is away, so Rose has to step in and be the mature one and watch after her little sister. She is mature, because in the conversation with Anna talking about her father, Rose is trying to soothe Anna's thoughts about missing her dad.
18929	7	0	If I had to use one trait to describe Rose from this story, I would say she is overwhelmed. In this story, I could tell by her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab that she felt like she had too much resting on her shoulders. For example, when Aunt Kolab says '... This must be difficult for you. Yes?' and Rose nods.
18930	7	0	Well Rose is upset because of her essay and Anna tries to confort her like any sister would and Rose is angry.
18931	7	0	Rose has forgotten how to care for others, by only looking towards the future and forgetting the present. From being over worked in the persuit of raising money for her brother she has lost sight of her sister and how to care for her. Here in this passage she directly ignores her sister, ' 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.' 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said' (Paragraph 7 Line 1).
18932	7	1	Rose is hopeful that since her aunt sees it her way that her life will get better.
18933	7	0	Her distress defines her as a character.  She is worried about what will happen and is feeling great pressure from her family to succeed and to contribute to the family.  I drew this from her Aunt's response to the dream, when she said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help the family?', a question  she did not answer because the truth would hurt her aunt.
18934	7	0	rose tried to anna can understand the real problem with their parents and she is trying to do her best to have a good family by her side but anna just dont get the situation. for example rose told anna that her parents need to work more and that they have to appreciate the opportunity that they are having in their job and anna just dont get that, thats a good opportunity for her family.
18935	7	0	Rose can be described by being stressed. In the story it state that her brain became exhausted and is always busy moving from one activity to another.
18936	7	0	I feel she is respectful because she listens patiently while the other person is speaking.
18937	7	0	Rose seems to always act like the mother in the house when her mother works late.  She goes to school, has a job, cooks supper for the family, then she does homework.
18938	7	0	In the passage Rose is feeling weighed down by her family because she has to work and go to school just to be able for her family to live a some what normal life. In her conversation with Anna, Anna has a different view of the story because she is younger and doesnt have to work she doesnt see the unjust position that her older sister and he mother are in. She doesnt understand why their father had to leave for a better paying job. Anna has a lot of resentment towards her family but she is continually trying to surpress her feelings. In Anna and Rose's conversation 'Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything' 'Only if you already have everything,' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This reveals that even though Rose loves her family she resents that she has to help send her brother to school, but she is putting on a brave face for her little sister and saying that even though they have to work hard it will all get better soon.
18939	7	1	Rose is composed. She is breaking under the weight of her essay, her job, and all the stress in her life, yet when Anna comes in to talk about her nightmare, Rose is calm and collected. 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.' Anna is distracting Rose from spending much needed time on her essay with a mundane topic, but Rose still speaks gently to her with the compassion of a loving sister.
18940	7	2	She is a very respectful person because Rose didnt answer her Aunt Kolabs question because it would hurt her aunt since she feels so weighed down by helping out her family.
18941	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose is caring. One detail from the story would be when she was thinking about the fate of two lives resting in Paul's hands and one resting in her hands.

18944	7	0	She is a worried person. She thinks that she does not want to have the responsibility that Paul had and she thinks that if she tells her aunt, her aunt will be upset.
18945	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she, though feels extremely weighed down by her many responsibilites, always puts the wellness of her family as a whole before her own well being.  This is shown during her conversation with her sister, Anna.  Anna is complaining about their father being gone but Rose argues that their father needed the far away job to help pay for Paul's, their older brother, college education so that when he gets a job he will help to pay for their education.
18946	7	2	Rose is a hard worker who works to exhaustion, as can be seen when she says, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' to Anna.
18947	7	0	While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, one trait that I saw was that her Aunt was very supportive. Her Aunt gave Rose a different point of view of the sitution by her saying they can find a way to do things different.

18954	7	0	Rose wishes to be successful; an overachiever with life and education. While talking to her sister, Rose says that her father went off for the better-- to make more money. Anna, Roses's sister, is furious and explains that money is not everything in life.Rose disagrees and says that they have to help Paul get through college, then herself, and Anna. She feels like she has to put the weight on her shoulders to benefit others. She overachieves, or tries to, throughout the beginning of the story.
18955	7	0	She tells her aunt everything and is very trustworthy, but she feels guilty about what happened to her brother.  She had the bad dream about her brother but made herself feel better by talking to her aunt.
18956	7	0	Rose tries to do so much for everyone that she is to exhausted to do things she issupposed to do, (school work.) As Rose says, 'EvenifIdowin,' she thought, 'I won't get to travel to Sacramento to receive the prize.'
18957	7	0	Rose is respectful to her elders, she does not want to be honest as to not offend her family. In paragraph 19, Rose didnt answer because it said she would hurt her aunt.
18958	7	0	Rose is scared, and feels that she has to much responsebilty for her age, in the story she has a dream of Paul weighing down on her, which would simbolize the the preasure she feels from having to do as much as she does.
18959	7	0	Rose feels stressed. You can tell this by the way she is actin when her sister is trying to talk to her. Anna is trying to tell Rose something and Rose says that she sounds just like Mama in an angry tone.
18960	7	1	Rose is an easy going person but she is also very stressed out because of all of the help that she is doing for the family so her brother can finish college. Rose has to work right after school and has no time for her school work.
18961	7	2	Rose always tried to do what was best for her family.  It was not until her dream about Paul's body drowning her that she realized how stressed she really was. As soon as her aunt suggested taking some of the weight off of Rose and doing more to help, Rose instantly felt a little bit more relaxed, and grateful towards her aunt.
18962	7	0	rose sees others points threw their eyes not just hers.it says in the story i realize thar you are seeing the situation throught through other eyes.
18963	7	2	Rose is encouraging. She was having a very rough day when Anna walked into the kitchen. Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Despite her feelings, she tried to encourage Anna and keep their conversation postive.
18964	7	2	'Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.'She seems undecided, but she's willing to take things as they come. She has a half positive outlook on things.
18965	7	1	Rose is caring because she is working herself until she is exhausted because she is trying to help out her family, by helping pay for her older brother's college.
18966	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is caring of her family. Rose fits in school, work, and helping her aunt cook dinner each day, even though she feels she has too much to handle. She continues to do these things because she feels it is her responsibility to help her family. In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, she admitted that she felt weighed down by everything she was doing. Her aunt then offered to sell treats from Cambodia to lessen Rose's responsibility, leaving Rose feeling lighter.
18967	7	0	I think that Rose is resentful of the fact that her family is not with her. That Paul needs the money their father is making while in Los Angeles that makes him have to be so far away from the rest of the family. Also that she feels that she has to help to bring Paul into college.
18968	7	0	Rose is very jealous of her brother Paul.
18969	7	1	Rose is very considerate of others and puts others before herself. This was shown when she talked to both Anna and Aunt Kolab. When she talked to Aunt Kolab she realized that everything she was doing for Paul and for the family was worth it. She shows this when she says, 'Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.'
18970	7	1	She is a hard worker. She goes to school, then straight to work, then home to cook, and finally does her homework which just so happens to be a 3000 word essay.

18974	7	0	In the story Rose is very mature. She is trying to succeed in school, help out around the house, and blance a job. Although her situation isn't ideal, she performs the same tasks everyday. I noticed her maturity when her Aunt asked is she felt weighed down by the family. Rose didn't reply because she didn't want to hurt her Aunt. This shows me that she not only understands the feeling of others, but also understand her families situation. At her age, this shows maturity.
18975	7	2	Rose is very determined. She does everything she can to help pay for her brother's college, even though she is exhausted and stressed. In the conversation between Rose and Anna in paragraph 11, Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' This statement shows that Rose knows how important it is for her and her sister to stick through the hard times to get the money for her brother.
18976	7	0	One trait that can describe Rosa is talented. Talented descrides her dream and yet the fact that she came up with a story about her dream. It was also creative, she didn't just pick some idea and settle with it, she put time and effort.
18977	7	2	One of the traits that Rose has is careing. During the conversation with Anna, Rose is asking her whats wrong and if she feels okay. She cares about her and her family. One other example would be when she is talkin to Aunt Kolab she doesnt want to tell her that its too much work for her to handle. She doesnt want to upset them, because she cares about how they feel.
18978	7	1	Rose is a dedicated person. While she is talking to Aunt Kolab, she figures out what topic she is going to write her essay about, which shows her dedication to getting her work done. Rose is also proved to be dedicated by working on her essay until she falls asleep and keeps up with school and a job.
18979	7	2	Rose cares about how other people will feel if she really tells them how she feels. For example when Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'if she feels wieghed down by what she is doing for her family'. Rose's response is,' if i told the truth, i would hurt my aunt and she might tell mother.
18980	7	2	Rose felt more hopeful after talking to her aunt. The story tells us that her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.
18981	7	0	Rose is very selfish.
18982	7	0	Rose is a strong individual because she hasn't seen her dad in four months.Plus she has to go to school then right after school she goes to work and after she gets off of work she has to do homework .

18984	7	0	'I hate how late she has to work'
18985	7	1	In the story, Aunt Kolab asked if Rose felt like the family is wieghing her down. Even though it was true, she decided not to answer. This makes me assume that Rose is a very helpful and respectful person.
18986	7	0	Rose is a person that tried and do watever she can to help out her family. Like she works at a restuarant to help around the house. Rose's mother always have to work late.
18987	7	0	One trait attributed to Rose is a sense of hopelessness. In the dream, she puictures her self collapsing under the weight of her responsibilities, and under her brother's.
18988	7	0	She is very mature and you can tell because she can fell the stress from Paul and knows her responsibilities.
18989	7	0	She has always been so busy.
18990	7	2	She has faith in everything she does, and she cares about her sister. I believe its because she tells her sister that everything will work out and that they will go to college like their brother.
18991	7	0	Rose hides how she really feels to both of the characters. This is one trait that she has and she shows it by not saying what she really whats too.
18992	7	0	One character trait that I can identify about Rose is that she is not very outspoken due to her conversation with Aunt Kolab. She seemed like she was scared to tell her aunt how she relly felt because she was afraid of hurting her aunt's and her mothers feelings.
18993	7	0	Rose is faithful. She is faithful because she doesn't want to hurt anyone in her family. She does what she is asked because she knows its the right thing to do. In the story the aunt askes 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help thins family?'  and Rose didn't answer because the truth would hurt her aunt and she doesn't want to hurt anyone. Rose is a good person.
18994	7	0	Rose acts like she is resentful to her family. When she lists all the struggles she went through with her normal day, it sounds like she resents having to do what seems like all the work. She goes to school, then to work at a restraunt, then she had to go home and work more to prepare dinner.
18995	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose is a presistance. Her school day was very long. After school, she went to work and did a long shift, then came home and made supper, and now she was trying to make a three-thounsand word essay. That takes someone who is a hard worker and who is persistant.
18996	7	1	Rose is very understanding in her attempt to calm Anna down. This trait is expressed by the way she trys to explain why Papa is gone. For example when Anna started to bring up the fact that Papa has bein gone for a while, Rose trys to help by saying, 'Its only been four months.'
18997	7	1	Rose is a heard worker like her dad. Her dad took a job in Los Angels. He doesnt get to see his family much

18999	7	0	Rose is obviously very confused, she has a great burden to carry, but is confused by what other people think of it.
19000	7	2	Rose is selfless. When Anna came into the kitchen to talk to her after her nightmare, she started talking about how she misses Papa and she wishes Mama didn't have to work such late hours. Anna, I'm sure, felt the same way, but she hid her feelings because she had to make Anna feel better. She had to put her little sister before herself.
19001	7	2	rose respects and cares about how other people might thin before she speaks. in the story she didnt want to tell her aunt something because she didnt want to hurt her feelings.
19002	7	1	Rose was a very hard working girl. She felt really lonely because her dad had just left and her mother worked most of the day. She said she felt too young for so much responsibility.

19005	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister Anna would be she sounds like she wants to be in charge of her sister Anna. Rose acts like a mother figure to Anna. One example from the passage would be when Anna rolled her eyes and shoved the chair away from the table and said 'You sound just like mama'.
19006	7	0	Rose doesn't think she is all to great.  In the beginning she was having trouble writing an essay.  She then tells her sister how she fell asleep while writing it and thinks money is everything.  Then later on she tells her Aunt Kolab of her dream and how much pressure is on her.  Rose thinks she is the underdog in the family.
19007	7	0	A trait to describe Rose would be stressed. Aunt Kolab said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. Rose didn't answer because if she told the truth, it would hurt her aunt.
19008	7	1	Rose is mature. We know this because when she talked to Aunt Kolab she does not want to hurt her Aunt and therefore does not answer the question about if she feels weighed down.
19009	7	0	Based on Rose's conversations with her Aunt and her sister, Rose is very mature from the situation she has already been put in. When Rose comes in the kitchen to find her Aunt she confesses that it is difficult.

19014	7	1	One trait that could be used to describe her would be, strong. Strength seems to fit her based on what she is trying to do for her family and trying to get a better education as well.
19015	7	2	Rose is generous. She doesn't tell about how she really feels because she's concerned about everyone else. It is shown in paragraph 18 Aunt Kolab says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing for this family?'. Then in paragraph 19 when the narrator states, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. This shows that Rose is generous and concerned of the well-being of others.
19016	7	0	Rose is very quiet. When she was talking to Aunt Kolab, she just kept nodding. When she was talking to Anna, she kept changing the subject and suppressing how she really felt about the situation.
19017	7	2	She is stressed, and seems to be having trouble managing everything that needs to be done, but she is willing to do it to help out her family. In her converstation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish College. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This passage shows that she is aware of how hard it is now, but all her work will pay off eventually.
19018	7	0	I would say that Rose is a sad girl who doesn't always know what to do and is trying to see if others would help with out makeings it worse on her or her family. She feels like she is the one that is holding the family together.

Her aunt offers other alternatives to making money and this is good for Rose. Although Rose knows its a good opprotunity, she does not get her hopes up because she knows that everything might not get better for her or her family. This shows she is realistic because she has hope, but she also knows the reality of the situation might not allow things to be improved.
19027	7	0	Rose is takes in to thougth to what her aunt said to change her thoughts that nothing would surely work out. 'Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't . But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'

One detail from the story that can support this is when she is explaining to Anna that Paul, their brother, will get a good job and pay for Anna and Rose to go to college. Rose is displaying her sense of optimism by talking about the good things that will happen in the future.
19040	7	2	Rose is very mature about her family problems. The example in the would be when she tells Anna 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paide three times what he was making here.'     She understands and still misses her father just as much as Anna.
19041	7	0	Rose seems to have a sense of duty. She says that 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college.'
19042	7	0	From this story we can infer that Rose is a worried person. She is always worried about other people and trying to be the best. She said she was worried about getting her essay done so she could win. She wanted to be the best and actually win the contest. Then she was worried because she couldn't make it to Sacremento to claim the prize if she did win. She had taken too much time off and was on the verge of getting fired. That made her worry even more because then she would be out of a job.
19043	7	0	Rose is very stressed out. The story lets me know by saying 'She felt too young for so much responsibility'
19044	7	0	When she is talking to her sister, and she does not respond to what Anna had to say shows she is not that caring about what other people have to say. She is more selfish.

19046	7	2	Rose is a very caring person who tries not to hurt anyone. You know this by the way the author stated that she tried to tell Anna as gentle as she could that their father had only been gone for four months. She wants tobe free, but rather she would want the happiness of her own family before hers. Since Rose is a caring person,  maybe that is why she didn't wan to hurt her aunt's feelings when they were having a conversation.
19047	7	0	Rose seems very busy, and she has no time to herself. She said she didn't know when she would squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay.
19048	7	1	One trait that can descirbe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is she's loyal to her family.  While she was conversing with her sister, she claims that she and Anna have to work hard for their brother. Also, Rose defends her mother and father when Anna complains that they're both away working.

19050	7	0	She is a good person. She only wants the best for Annna.
19051	7	2	I think one trait that can describe Rose would be how caring and unselfish she is. In the story Rose says, with her hands cupped, 'Pauls fate lies partly in these.' She cares abut Paul so that is why she tries so hard in everything she does.
19052	7	1	Rose is a hard worker. She goes to work at the restaurant and still comes home to help cook supper. After supper she does her homework. She also is trying to win a three thousand word essay contest.
19053	7	1	I think Rose is a very caring person.  She cares about Anna and her parents.  She realized that her dad had to go get that better job to support the family.  One detail from the story is that Rose cares about her job and her family.  She believes her parents must work to provide for them
19054	7	1	Rose is a very determined person because of what she does for her family. Despite all the stress from school and work, she still finds time to write an essay for a competition outside of school.

19055	7	0	Rose can't help remember her father sinking to the floor.
19056	7	0	One trait that describes Rose is confused. One thing that supports this is that she doesnt know what she wants to do in life when she was talking to her aunt.
19057	7	2	Rose is very understanding. She isn't stubborn about doing things that other American teenagers wouldn't ever have to do. She understands that her family needs her help in supporting her brother, sister, and everyone else. One detail from the story would be this: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college...' found in paragraph 11, line 2.
19058	7	0	Rose's younger sister walked in rubbing her eyes because Rose was having a bad dream.
19059	7	0	Rose is a very optimistic person. When she was talking to Anna, she was able to always look on the bright side of their situation. Anna was naming the bad things that are going on in their lives at the time, and Rose always said something optimistic.
19060	7	1	Rose is a very caring and understanding person, but she feels as thought he familys weight on her is pushing her down. Her dream would be a good example of this  and how it is affecting her.
19061	7	0	Rose sees the need to have money for the family, while her sister would rather not have as much money and everyone be together and at home.  Anna doesn't want their father to be in Los Angeles or their mother working so late.  Rose, however, explains to her sister, that the money is needed to be able to live and their brother to be able to get a college education that would let him get a good job.  The good job would then help bothe Rose and Anna go to college.
19062	7	0	One trait that was about Rose was that she wanted Papa to go and just come back with the money. It was all about the money, untill she started talking to her sister and then had the dream. That changed it all, her perspective of the whole situation was totally different.
19063	7	2	Rose is understandig, because she understood that her father went away for a better paying job.
19064	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is very caring of other people. In paragraph 19, sentence 2, Rose chooses not to answer Aunt Kolab's question. If she tells her the truth, Rose knows that the statement will hurt her, so she doesn't say it.
19065	7	2	Rose is responsible in here conversation with Anna. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She is helping her brother through college so she can then go to college too. That shows a great deal of responsiblity.

19070	7	1	Rose seems to be a very caring person. She tends to keep her pain bottled up in front of her younger sister, Anna. She does this because she wants to instill hope in her baby sister. Rose knows that the situation the family is in is difficult for Anna to handle being so young. When Anna and Rose are talking in the kitchen Anna mentions missing their father. Although Rose misses her dad deeply, she finds a way to justify him being gone, again for Anna's sake.
19071	7	0	A trait that I think that Rose has is commitment. I think this because she goes to school, works, helps with dinner and still does her homework. It takes a lot to do so much through out one day and her commitment to doing all of this is helping her and her family.
19072	7	0	They have the same ataitod as each other like when the two sisters are fighting in the kitchen.
19073	7	1	Rose is determined.  When she talks to her little sister Anna, she feels that she needs to be brave for Anna and not show her how she really feels, so she won't worry Anna.
19074	7	2	She is caring. In paragraph 5 she is conserned about her sister and ask her if she's feeling okay.
19075	7	1	She worries about her father so I guess she cares deeply about people. In paragraph 14 she says 'In the dark Pose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate les partly in these.' Shes obviously worried about her father, and in paragraph 8 shes worried about her mom having to work so late.
19076	7	1	Rose is very selfless. Your hear in the story about ll of the stress and anxiety in her life in order to help her brother go to college but she doen't complain to others. When Rose's Aunt offers to help with the situtation and take some stress off of Rose's shoulders Rose doesn't show excitement for the relief of all her stress. Rose just politely nodds and thinks about how maybe her life will become easier.
19077	7	1	Rose is responsible and understanding. She does everything she can to help her family and doesn't complain about how hard it is on her.
19078	7	2	Rose is sympathetic towards her family. I know this because in Rose's and her and Aunt Kolab's conversation Rose didnt answer when her aunt asked, 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' because she knows if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And her aunt would probably of told her mother.
19079	7	0	Rose got help from there aunt. That means that she got help instead of not doing her essay. Her aunt told her that she should do the essay on the Cambodian tradition and sense of family. She also discovered that she could survive an ocean crossing.
19080	7	2	One trait that Rose has is hope. Even though her family is having hard times, she is still hoping her and Anna will be able to go to college. Rose shows hope when she says: 'we gave our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he`ll get a good job, Anna, and he`ll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19081	7	2	Rose is very dedicated to her family and is willing to do what she can to help them.Rose has a job to help put her brother through college and she helps her aunt cook dinner when her mother is at work.
19082	7	0	Guilty;             Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?
19083	7	0	When Rose clasped her hands together. Picturing the fact that she was clasping and cupping her hands to prove a point.' In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands.'
19084	7	2	Rose is thoughtfull. When she was asked if she felt like she was being weighed down by having to take a big role in taking care for her family, she kind of knodded instead of complaining about it to her aunt.
19085	7	1	A trait that can descrie Rose based on her conversation with both Anna and Aunt Kolab would have to be worried or frantic. This is because she is worried about her essay and her family as well, which builds a lot of pressure on her. In the end she will eventually snap from all the unnesseccary pressures.
19086	7	2	Rose seems like the type of person who would worry to much. But at the same time she likes to help people and she cares about other people too. For example, Rose asks her sister if she was okay to see what was wrong with her.
19087	7	0	She doesn't like to tell anyone how she is really feeling if it'll end up hurting them. In paragraph 19, she shows how she thinks Aunt Kolab would react if she told how she really feels about helping with the family.
19088	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose would be hard working. It says in the second paragragh that Rose had gone to work strait from school, works a four-hour shift, then goes straight home to do homework. I would imagine that Rose would be a very hard worker knowing that she has a job and she is smart in school, and has the opportunity to send a letter in and get sent to Sacramento just to recieve the prize. So in my eyes Rose is a very hard worker.
19089	7	1	Rose has many traits, but one that stands out to me is her willing to thrive, and how hard working she is. Rose had long days, but she never stopped. Rose went to school, the straight to a four-hour shift, the straight home to help her Aunt Kolab for dinner, then she worked on her home work. She never stopped to take time for herself or a social life.
19090	7	0	Rose is a very busy person. First, she has a long exhuasting day of school. After school, she works a four-hour shift. Then she runs home and helps Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. Finally, she has to do her homework.
19091	7	0	In her conversations, we can see that Rose is scared to say how she really feels. In the story it says that 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
19092	7	2	I would describe her as strong willed, because when she is talking with her aunt Kolab she knows she is doing alot but doesn't complain about it.
19093	7	0	takes thing on herself
19094	7	1	Rose best character trait is she stays postive with other characters. Rose does'nt let other characters know how she really feel's, because she would rather help them. A strong example of this is when Anna is upset about their father being gone. Rose explains to Anna that he is geting valuable money, so that they can go to college.
19095	7	2	Rose is a caring person that does not want to hurt anyone's feelings. You can tell this because, when she is talking to both her aunt and her sister she tries to down play  her true feeling so neither person worries about her. One example of this is when Rose does not answer her aunt for fear of hurting her.
19096	7	0	One trait of Rose is that she wants to be like evryone else. An example of when she acts this way, is when she is talking to her sunt. Her aunt asks her if she resents her family because she has to help them out and if she doesn't understand why because she sees the situation through others eyes. Rose answers yes.
19097	7	0	A trait that describes Rose would be strong. Rose has to help the family a lot and has the job of taking care of her family members. Her aunt steps in at the end of the short story to help her overcome her stress and everything that is going on.

19099	7	2	Rose has a good trait that is for looking for hope. When she was talking to her aunt she relized that it won't always be like this.

19101	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with her Aunt Kolab is that Rose had a nightmare. Rose feels that she is under a lot of pressure and she has a lot of responibilies to take care of since her mom works all night. When she wakes up she does not want to talk to anyone. Her Aunt Kolab finally getes her to talk to her. Rose opens up to her Aunt Kolab telling her how she feels. Her Aunt Kolab tells her its going to be okay.
19102	7	0	During her conversation with Anna, Rose shows her bravery. Rose has alot going on in her life but she is willing to do everything she can to help her sister and the rest of their family. Rose tries to laugh when Anna is upset in line 12. Rose tries to be light hearted about her families struggle. Rose is a teenager and is dealing with conflict way beyond her years; this shows great bravery.
19103	7	0	Rose worries alot and feels weighted down when shes talking with her aunt
19104	7	0	Rose is very mature at multitasking and working to benefit her family.  When Aunt Kolab asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she's doing to help the family, Rose is not honest with her Aunt because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings.

In the passage Rose talks about how exausted she is and how she goes from her four hour shifts at the restaurant to cooking with her family and expects herself to write a 3,000 word essay that is flawless.  Although Rose wants to be wonder girl she is still human.  She needs to let others help her in supporting her family, not take on the job all by herself.
19150	7	1	One trait about Rose is that she is a very caring person.  She will try to help out as much as she can and will try to make the bes out of everything.  She tries to make Anna and Aunt Kolab by simply agreeing with them and being there for them.

19153	7	1	Rose is not a selfish person.  She wants to please others so badly that she often is exsaperated and freaking her self out to the point that her dreams have to relay how she feels to her.           Her aunt asked 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose decided not to answer because she felt if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt and her family.

19161	7	2	Rose is a very caring person. During both her converstaions in the story she wants the other person to be alright. She asks Anne is she is okay and tries to see what's wrong with her. In her converstion with Aunt Kolab she was afraid to answer truthfully because she didn't want to hur her aunt.
19162	7	2	Based upon the story, it can be concluded that Rose cares about other people's feelings.  In paragraph 19, Rose does not allow her aunt to realize that she feels so greatly burdened by her responsiblities.  She believes that if her aunt were to know this fact, she would be hurt and will also tell her mother, who then would also be hurt.
19163	7	0	Rose supresses her feelings and keeps them bottled up. Her aunt asked her a question and she didnt answer because she knew she would get hurt if she answer. She would have rather kept to herself.
19164	7	2	I think one trait that would best describe Rose would be had working. In the story Rose is so busy because she is trying to help her family as best as she can and starts to feel pressured by it. Rose does a lot. She goes to work, comes home, help make dinner, and does her homework. I thinkg that shows that she is hardworking because most people crack and fail but she keeps doin because she wants to help her family and go to a good college.
19165	7	2	Rose is a understanding person. Rpse acknowledges that her dad has to be away so that her brother can go to coellege and get a good job. Rose understands that she is helping to put Paul through coellege and he will help her and Anna.

19168	7	0	Rose want to help as much as she can but feels weighted because she is so young and has so much responsibility. She confesses to this when her aunt calls her out on it.
19169	7	1	Based on the story Rose character trait shows that she is a very responsible person. Rose has a big responsiblity on her hands and is determined to do everything. She doesn't want to let anyone down because she doesn't want anyone to be disappointed in her. Rose has a big role to feel, something like what her brother Paul had to deal with. Rose didn't want to let Aunt Kolab down. She didn't want her to be upset with her so she put her responsinblities last to put Aunt Kolab's first.
19170	7	1	Rose puts others before herself.  She does not skip work or not help with dinner to write her essay.  She does everything she can to help her family out.
19171	7	1	One trait Rose had in her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring. She is caring about trying to help her family.
19172	7	2	Rose looks at the positives in life, and not the negatives.  In her conversation with Aunt Kolab she is thinking that maybe her life would get easier.
19173	7	1	Anna was only a high school student with alot on her mind. She had the responsibility of an adult. For an example she not only had to live her kid life by going to school and doing homework, but she also had a job and had to take care of her little sister and also she helped prepare food. All of that can cause a lot of stress which is why she was sleepy and day dreaming and which is also why she had that dream, because drems do relate to what you'r feeling. So therefore all of that made her stronger and also gave her something to write about in the end for her essay.
19174	7	0	I think Rose is stressed out because of how urgently she needs to tell Aunt Kolab about her dream.
19175	7	1	Rose lives poor. She supports her family and feels like the world is caving in on her. She cant handle the pursure anymore and don't want to tell anyone.
19176	7	0	idk because i cant read jp
19177	7	0	Rose is very outgoing. She goes to school, works, cares for her family, and still makes time for her school work. She keeps her belief that if she can help her brother through college he will help her through school so she can live a better life than what she has at the time. Anna tells Rose money isn't everything, Rose says differently, that money isn't everything, if you already have everything.
19178	7	0	Rose feels like everything that Anna and she does, relates to Paul in some how. In the story it says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19179	7	0	She gets stressed over work greatly and she expresses this in her conversation with Anna by saying 'I fell asleep working on my essay.'
19180	7	1	Rose is sincere about her family and would do anything for them but she is starting to feel the pressure of trying to follow Paul's footsteps and be as successful as he is. In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought. She felt too young for so much responsibility.
19181	7	1	Rose is caring and cares for her sister. She tells her about her parents and brother and lets her know things will be fine.
19182	7	0	She is mean
19183	7	0	Well during the conversation of Rose and Aunt Kolab, I noticed that Rose is confused about certain things when it comes to Cambodia.  When they talk about looking at something in a different perspective, I see Rose not looking at in jer eyes, but in everyone else's eyes.  'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal,' her aunt said.  'But now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes--as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here.... This must be difficult for you. Yes?'
19184	7	0	SHE FEELS LIKE THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD IS ON HER SHOULDER
19185	7	0	anna thinks Rose is to worried about the essay and Rose thinks even if she wins she wont even get to travel to Sacramento to recive the prize
19186	7	1	Rose is determined and responible for many things. In paragraph 2, it talks about how long Rose's day is and what she has to do. She has schooling and work, but most of all shes respectful by going straight home to help her family.
19187	7	0	Rose sometimes suppresses her feelings from others.      'Only if you already have everything,' Rose said. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'    Rose says this, but leaves out how tired and horrible it really is for her.
19188	7	1	From this story you can infer that Rose has a strong sense of responsibility. You can easily see this in her internal conflicts. 'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought' This shows that she knows full well what is on her shoulders. She knows the amount of work she must put in.
19189	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose is nervous. Because when Rose was talking to her sister she was nervous to tell her sister about her feelings. When Rose was talking to her aunt she was nervous to tell her aunt how she felt because she thought she would mess up the family.
19190	7	1	Rose is a caring and polite person, because she tiptoed into Anna and her bed room so that she wouldn't wake Anna up.
19191	7	0	She is emotional, and worries about everybody else.  'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands.  Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'
19192	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is caring.  Even though Rose probably feels just as bad as Anna does because their father is gone, she hides and it does her best to comfort Anna.  The line, 'She tried a laugh that sounder fake even to her.' suggests that Rose doesn't nesecarily believe everything she is saying.  She says it to make Anna feel better though and that is why she is caring.
19193	7	1	Rose is a good, kind-hearted person who was trying to be positive for her sister. When Anna was mad about her dad leaving, her mom being at work, and the family having no money, Rose tried to lighten the mood and make her sister laugh. Even though she had stayed up late with the paper and was cranky, she never took it out on Anna.
19194	7	1	One trait in this conversation would be understanding. She talks about how her aunt could go sew for women, this would make her not have to work so much.
19195	7	2	Rose is very caring for her family she helps out as much as she can and is exhausted, and she doesnt want to let her family feel bad. An example is when Rose didnt want to tell her aunt that she feels weighed down, because she knew it would hurt her feelings.
19196	7	1	In this story, Rose seems to be very mature. She tells Anna that her father took the job in Los Angeles so that he could make more money to support the family. In this, Rose pushes aside the emotional longing to see her father more often and states that he's doing whats best for the family.
19197	7	2	Rose is a very understanding girl.  She recognizes that some hard decisions are made for the best.  She knows that her father had to take the job in Los Angeles because it paid three times what he made originally.
19198	7	2	Rose looks at the bright side of things. When her sister, Anna was talking about how she missed their father Rose was the one saying that it was a good thing that he was gone because their family needs the money.
19199	7	0	It seems like Rose is an outgoing girl but doesnt have any confidents in herself. It looks like she gives up to soon, before she even try's. Like when she's talking to her sister and she says 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years'. Well it just seems like she doesn't think she can do anymore until he comes back. Also, if she writes the 300 word essay she has a chance to go to Sacramento but then she says my boss is already mad at me and i would more likly get fired. Well right then is where she's giving up. She could go to her boss and talk to him about it but instead she pretty much gives up.
19200	7	2	Rose is caring and hardworking, in paragraph 11 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then hel'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to collage.' Right their shows that Rose is working at somthing and she cares about someone because she knows it will pay off in the long run.
19201	7	2	One trait to describe Rose would be understanding.Detail:  'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'Although she probably wants her father there like her sister, she is understanding as to why he had to leave.
19202	7	2	Based on her conversations, Rose can be described as caring. During her conversation with Anna, Rose kept trying to sound postive and look on the bright side of things. When Anna talked about how long it seemed that their father had been gone, Rose tried to make it seem better by reminding Anna that 'It's only been four months.' By doing this, you can tell that Rose cares about her sister's feelings.
19203	7	2	One of Rose's traits would be that she is hard working. In the story she talks about how she goes to school, then she works a 4 hour shift, and after that she gets home and does her homework.
19204	7	0	She's dishonoret to Aunt Kolab when she lied to her Aunt because if she told the truth she would have hurt her Aunt.
19205	7	0	Based on the conversation that Rose had with Aunt Kolab, the reader can see that Rose feels overwhelmed by her job. Aunt Kolab asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose doesn't answer because the answer is yes; she does feel weighed down by her job, but she doesn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings.
19206	7	2	Rose seems to be very understanding, she's willing to do anything to help Paul with college and doesn't second guess it. When she's talking to Anna she tells her,'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
19207	7	1	I can infer that Rose is more concerned about her little sister that she is about herself.  I can tell this because she seems to hide her true emotions when speaking to Anna.  Rose tells Anna exactly, 'It's only been four months.  He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'  After this a few lines down Anna tells Rose, 'You sond just like Mama.'  I am sure that Rose has heard all that she said from her mother and was simply repeating it to Anna to comfort her little sister.
19208	7	0	Blunt. Rose straight out explains to Anna and Aunt Kolab how she feels.
19209	7	0	One trait that describes Rose is smart, because her sister doesn't get that money is accually everything in this world. Rose knows that in order to survive money is needed.
19210	7	0	Rose feels somewhat guilty.
19211	7	1	Rose is thoughtful. She talks about her brother during most of the story and you can see how bad she wants to help him. She has an essay that is due and she won't even try to start on it because she is so worried about her brother.

19214	7	1	When Rose talks to Anna, she feels exhausted. She is trying to help the family so much that she is unable to think strait. Rose can't think of anything to write for her essay and when she starts working on it, she is distracted. The first time Anna had woke Rose up because she had a bad dream. Then Anna and Rose talk about where their mom is.
19215	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is self centered, and has a busy life and is always exhausted. An example is when Rose woke up and the rubbing her neck. She remebered that she was thinking of a topic, for her essay, for the state competition when her brain got exhustated and fell asleep.

19224	7	0	Rose does not like to make people feel bad.  She will not say anything or she will say something that makes you feel better rather than worse.  Like when Rose and Anna talked Rose told the things to Anna as gently as she could.

19227	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is hope.  Aunt Kolab gave Rose the feeling of hope by exploring other options that could benefit the family.  One detail that supports my answer is Rose recognizing that her life would get easier if people search opportunities to help support their family.
19228	7	0	Rose is so exhaulted about writting her essay. She keeps on falling asleep while trying to write it.
19229	7	0	Based on the conversations Rose had with Anna and Aunt Kolab you can tel that she is very soft spoken, as well as shy.  During her first conversation she holds back what she is truly feeling inside.  Then in the second conversation she simply nods agreeing with her Aunt. Both of these help convey Rose's shy and soft spoken personality trait.
19230	7	0	She suppressed her feelings until she couldn't keep them inside her any more. When she talked to Anna, she made everything sound fine, but she really missed her father too.
19231	7	0	In the story I feel like Rose was a very realistic person. I think this because when Rose discussed the topic about their father not being around with Anna, Rose knew he was gone for a reason to help his family and she knew that was how things had to be to support their family.
19232	7	0	rose didnt answer because she new that tekking the truth would hurt her aunt.
19233	7	2	Considerate, when she was talking to Aunt Kolab, instead of telling her how she really felt, she did not say anything because she knew it would hurt her Aunt's feelings.
19234	7	1	Rose seems to be very hardworking. This is used in the story because it says she on a regular day she goes to school and then has to work, then she has to cook dinner, and then do homework. This shows that she is hard working and takes on a lot of responsibilities.

19236	7	1	Rosa shows that she cares about her family by helping them in time of need. Rosa carries much responsibility including working a four hour shift every day to make extra money to suppose her family. Other than that Rosa has other obligations as a student and child but set them aside so her family can rely on her.

19238	7	0	Rose is worried that she won't get the essay done. She states,' When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thosand-word essay?' This makes me think she's worried about getting it done.
19239	7	2	She is a responsible girl, based on the part where she is talking about helping her brother pay for college so that he can help when she goes to college.
19240	7	0	Rose is a very mature girl.
19241	7	2	Rose is a girl who really cares about her family and if something needs to be done she will do it. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Aunt Kolab asks if rose feels weighed down and because Rose didnt want to hurt her  aunt and felt like it was her job she did not tell her aunt the truth. Showing that she cares for her family and she will do what needs to be done.
19242	7	0	Rose is a respectfull being. She is worried about how her sister, Anna, is feeling when she walks in rubbing her eyes.
19243	7	0	Rose's character, I believe, can be summed up in a short few sentences between her and her sister Anna. In paragraph 10, sentence 2, Anna states that in her opinion, 'Money isn't everything.' Rose's feelings towards this statement are quite obvious with her response in paragraph 11, sentence 1: 'Only if  you already have everything.' Here, we can interpret from her words, that Anna feels money, especially in her family's case, is quite important. She feels that money usually is very important, unless you have everything else. In this sentence, we can see a glimpse of how Rose feels about the dependancy of money when it comes to the outcome of her and her sister's futures.
19244	7	0	Rose is confused. You can see this when her aunt says, 'This must be difficult for you.'
19245	7	2	She doesnt like to hurt peoples feelings, she vents to her sister and when her aunt comes home she she asks her whats wrong but she doesnt answer she doesnt want to hurt her aunts feelings.   In the story her aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family'? she doesnt answer, she knows what she wants to say will hurt her aunts feelings.
19246	7	0	Rose is relyable when she tells Anna that they have to help Paul finish college.
19247	7	0	During her conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Anna is very quiet and is not sure about what to say to her aunt about how she really feels. Aunt Kolab tells rose to close her eyes and try to picture her own life through the eyes of another person who is dealing with a similar situation. Rose's Aunt wants rose to realize that no matter how hard her life may seem at any time, theres always going to be a little light at the end of the darkest tunnel that Rose will face. All Aunt Kolab want to do is find the easiest way to make Anna feel better about her conflict. She wants her to know that even if it seems hard to get passed, there will always be a way to get around it.
19248	7	0	She is a very busy person, she hardly ever has time to do anything while shes at school, working, or helping her aunt with supper.
19249	7	1	hardworkingfrom school shed gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper after that it was time to do homework
19250	7	0	If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  Rose did not want to hurt her aunt or her mother to find out so she did not answer her.
19251	7	1	How she still has some hope left after all thats been done through out her life. When she's talking to Anna about thier father she knows things are bad but for her sister's sake she has to be strong and believe things will get better.
19252	7	2	Hopeful. Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.
19253	7	2	Rose, when speaking to Aunt Kolab, shows a great deal of respect. I know this because when her aunt asked her about being weighed down, Rose didn't want to say her real answer because it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her mothers feelings. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' As you can see in this qoute from the passage, this supports my conclusion.
19254	7	1	Rose is like a mother, always worrying and trying to act older than she should. When Rose and Anna were talking about college, 'And he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'Anna said she 'sounded just like mama.'
19255	7	2	Well, Rose seems like a very hard working young women, by having school, a job, and coming home to help her aunt make a quick supper. Also after all of that, do her homework. paragraph one.
19256	7	0	Rose trusts that her brother will graduate college and pay for Rose and Anna's college. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19257	7	1	she cares for Aunt Kolab. she doesnt want to tell the truth about how Rose4 hurts because she feels like the weight of the family is on her.  she goes to school, then she works a four hour shift at the restaurant and then helps Aunt kolab fix dinner.
19258	7	2	In Rose's conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab Rose comes off as selfless, is not worrying about herself, but about her brother, and putting him through college so she and her sister can go to college, but at the same time she is trying to comfort her sister and assure her that everything that the family is for the best. It is for Anna and Rose's future. This is shown when Anna and Rose are speaking of how their parents are working so hard they hardly get to spend time with their family, but Rose tells her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This passage shows how Rose is selfless, comforting her sister, even when she is drowing under the pressure she is under, so her family has a better future.
19259	7	2	One trait that can descrive Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she thinks about other peoples feelings. One example from the story that supports that she thinks about other peoples feeling is when she is talking to her Aunt Kolab in paragraph 19 when she said 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
19260	7	2	In her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as being a maternal figure for Anna. Rose tries to calm Anna after her bad dream, and not tell her how she really feels about the situation their family was in.
19261	7	2	A trait that describes Rose is she cares about her family and their feelings. A detail from the story that supports my answer is when Anna is talking with her aunt she does not want to tell her aunt the truth because she is afraid it will hurt her feelings.
19262	7	1	Rose is supportive of her famliy because she see the job that her dad took in Los Angeles as an opportunity for more money to support the family, she says that her dad did the right thing during  her conversation with Anna
19263	7	1	Rose is very dedicated to her family. She works hard and gets all her school work done in order to support her brother while he is going to college.
19264	7	0	She's a dreamer. She had a dream.
19265	7	2	Rose is a very caring person. She cares for her family dearly. She only wants what's best for her family. Rose unlike Anna understands that you have to make sacrifices for a better life. So though it might be hard now. It will later be better for her and her family.
19266	7	2	I think that Rose is very giving and wants to help her brother and her family but is stressed about it. I also think she realizes it will get better and in the end she will have help from everyone in her family, just as they are helping her brother. Like she said to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll find a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19267	7	0	Rose is very sentimental. She takes on the role of being Anna's mom when their real mom isn't there. After Rose realizes that Anna is very upset whie walking in to the room, Rose immediatly asks Anna what is wrong and tries to comfort her.
19268	7	1	Responsable. She told her sister that they had to do what they were doing so there brother could graduate collage and help them get to collage.
19269	7	0	Exausted, I think this is a great trait to decribe Anna because she is exausted with having to work and go to school in order to support her family in the best way she can. One example from the passage is when she has her is talking to her Aunt Kolab, and she asks her if she feels wieghted down. She doesn't reply to try not to make her Aunt feel disappointed with her.
19270	7	2	She is caring. She asks her sister what is wrong and if she is feeling okay.
19271	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose would be that she is determined.  Rose goes to school regularly and also has a job.  She also helps around at home with whatever needs to be done.      Rose does not give up on things that are important to her or her family.  Even when things are difficult and she does not feel like she has enough time to finish, she still puts all her effort into getting the job done.  She feels over worked at times, and occasionally has doubts, but she works through them and continues on.
19272	7	1	She is feels very responsible because it shows to everyone in  the family
19273	7	0	Rose tell her aunt how busy and stress she is. Rose tell how her problem relates to her dream.
19274	7	1	She is a very hard working girl. In the story it states that sh goes to school, from school she goes straight to work, from work she comes home and makes supper for the family, and barley has time for school work.
19275	7	0	Rose's conversation with Anna shows that she will not give up at anything.  It also shows that she has way to many things to do in a day.  She also shows that she truely does care about others but she juse doesn't know how to show it.
19276	7	1	She worries for her family . She pours Anna orange juice and comforts her with how her fater is responsible with paul going to college. When paul got a job he would soon be responsible to send his sisters off to college.
19277	7	0	One trait that I believe describes Rose is lonely. I believe she is lonely because no one understands the way she is feeling. For example, when Anna and Rose were talking Anna didn't care about what Rose was telling her. Anna rolled her eyes and left the room.
19278	7	2	She trys to help other people out however she can, she shows this because she is helping paul finish college.
19279	7	0	'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.I think this means that Rose is a busy person and tries to push herself to do many things in her day and gets tired often.
19280	7	0	Rose is a conflicted character. She feels weighed down by all she has to do to help her family and herself. She has to help pay for her brothers education and has to work on her education too.      'In the dark Rose clasped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'
19281	7	0	Anna cares about her family very much.  Her sister and her don't always get along but they will try to work things out.     It said that she rolled her eyes, pushed her chair away from the table, stoodup and stalked out of the kitchen is a good way to explain that they don'talways get along
19282	7	1	Rose cares about her family. She sees her sister and the first words out of her mouth are, 'Anna, what's wrong? You feel okay?'
19283	7	0	Rose is an outgoing person. Even though Anna is upset that her father had to leave and her mother is working late Rose tries to make it seem better by saying that their fathers pay is being tripled.
19284	7	2	One trait that can describe Anna would be motivation.  Anna has a lot of motivation to help her family.  She doesn't want to see her family struggle so she does everything she can to help out like earning money by working at a restaurant.  A detail form the story that supports my answer would be when she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
19285	7	1	I believe Rose is very grateful about things in her life. Even though she feels stressed and pressured to make it easier for everyone else she doesn't tell her Aunt Kolab. She knows it's kind of her job to be that way. It definately shows when her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down and it says 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
19286	7	0	She was scared to tell her ant the truth so she asked her a question instead of just coming out with what she needed to say. So I can say that she is lonesome or does not trust any one with her feelings. it shows this in paragragh 19
19287	7	1	Rose is a hard working girl. She gets up to go to school and when school gets out she goes to work and works a four hour shift. Then goes home to help Aunt Kolab fix a quick supper then shes off to do her homework. Rose trys her hardest at everything she does to help her family.
19288	7	2	In the story, Rose stated, 'I'm insane,' in paragraph 3. The impression that I get from her is that she is overwhelmed with things. It seems as if she is in a hopeless state of mind. People expect her to do her best, and she believes that people think too highly of her. But towards the end of the story, her emotions change when her and her aunt are having a conversation. In paragraph 23, it states, 'Maybe her life will get better.' Now she is in a hopeful state of mind. Rose seems to be the type of person that is easily influenced and let's things get to her at times.
19289	7	0	Rose seems to be an encourager. You can tell this by how she tries to encouraged her little sister, even though she felt discouraged herself.
19290	7	2	Rose is hopeful. Rose said 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
19291	7	0	Rose is a realist, who does not hold onto dreams. She believes that nothing is easy, and she knows the truth. For example when Rose and Anna are discussing their father and his taking a job far away. Rose explains he had no other choice, that his job was the best decision for the family.
19292	7	2	According to the text one trait of Anna's would be that she really cares about her family. It goes to show in the text the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab. Rose feels weighed down by the family because her dad departed to Los Angeles to take a job and her mother always works late. In Rose's dream of her brother jumping in the water on top of her showed that she is too worried to relax. Aunt Kolab even asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family and Rose doesn't answer but, she know thats how she feels.
19293	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is that she is caring doesn't want to make anybody feel bad because of her struggles. She wants to comfort everybody and make them feel as good as she possibly can. A supporting detail of this is when she Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down by all of the work she had to do and she wouldn't answer because she didn't want to make her aunt feel bad.
19294	7	1	Rose seems like a mother in this story when she is talking to Anna.  Anna says that 'You sound just like mama'.  I think that Rose is a caring individual and could be more mature for her age.
19295	7	2	Rose is a caring person.  You can tell she's caring when she asks Anna 'What's wrong?  You feel okay?'
19296	7	0	rose is a busy person and she likes to make ladi clother or she likes making clothes period.
19297	7	0	Rose seems to feel the weight of the family rests on her shoulders, she questions herself and culture by asking, 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal, ... '  She thinks that they are different almost in a bad way perhaps.  When her aunt offers to spread their culture it reassures Rose that she is normal.
19298	7	0	that she domeniant about most of the thing that she does.
19299	7	0	She's trying to help her sister understand and make her feel better about everything in her family.
19300	7	0	Rose is somewhat of a people pleaser. When she is talking to Anne she tries to justify everything but when really she hurts and hates the situation just as much as Anne.
19301	7	1	One trait that describes Rose is that she is a hard worker. A detail that supports this is the line that says 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'
19302	7	2	Rose is a very caring person.  She thinks of others first, and is willing to do anything to help her family.  When Rose retells her dream to Aunt Kolab, her aunt questions if Rose feels pressure to support her family.  However, before Rose answered truthfully, Rose thought of her family's feelings and decided to hide her true thoughts in order to spare her family from disappointment.  Based on these details, it is obvious Rose is a loving person who puts her family first.
19303	7	2	Rose caring person or sempatheticRose tryed to help out Anna and she just got mad and left.
19304	7	1	Rose is a very hard working young lady and the reason I say that is because she's going to school, working to help out with the family, go home and help make supper with her aunt, and then do her homework. Rose is really trying to make it through school but she is having a hard time because of the trials and tribulations she's goin through at home and school.
19305	7	1	One trait that describes Rose is thoughtful, because when her Aunt Kolab asked her 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this amily?' and Rose didn't answer because she thought she might tell her mother.
19306	7	0	Rose is a Mysterious person because she is keeping secrets that her Family should know.

19309	7	0	Anne didn't care about money, she wanted her dad to be their for her when she need it his help. She can live poor and be happy but not rich and unhappy.
19310	7	0	Rose is concerned about all the important things around her. The essay, being new to the United States, and getting Paul, her brother, through school. Rose heroically confronts these challenges with a little help from Aunt Kolab. Aunt Kolab encourages Rose and gives her hope and purpose.

19312	7	1	Rose is very hardworking, she never gives up and she knows her family needs money, so she feels like the weighh of the world is on her shoulders. When her aunt offers to help her she feels some relief because now there is someone else to help her carry that burden. her aunt offered to sew for ladies or make special treats for our country and sell them. Rose is so grateful to have a great person in her life to  help her carry that burden.
19313	7	0	When talking to Aunt Kolab, Rose's stress is releaved. She is a worrier, and wants to take care of her family.
19314	7	2	Loyalty and Respect.  One detail is when Rose is talking about helping Paul finish college, which shows how loyal and dedicated she is.
19315	7	0	she is tierd, she is always just waking up
19316	7	0	Rose can be described as conservative in the stroy. This is shown through the fact that she is very conservative in her thoughts about the family difficulties involving money. By being conservative with her thoughts, she proves that the family is more important to her than her own personal well being. This is shown in the conversation that Rose has with Anna when Rose plays off the entire family problem as if it were not a large deal to her, when in reality she was worried and frightened by their family's problems and is experiencing many internal conflicts that are rooted in the family's problems.
19317	7	1	Rose is a very caring person, she trys to comfort Anna in their conversation.
19318	7	2	When reading this story it is easy to see that Rose is a caring person.  Her Aunt Kolab asks her if she is having a difficult time handling this situation.  Since Rose cares about how her Aunt Kolab feels, she supresses her true feelings.
19319	7	1	Rose has the trait of being kind and caring for her family. Durning her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab she says many meaningful things to them. When Aunt Kolab says 'But now I relieze that you're seeing the situation through other eyes' tells us that Rose is caring about how other people feel about what is happening and not only looking at things in her own eyes. She is thinking outside of her little space. She is not being selfish.
19320	7	2	Rose is overwhelmed with things she has to do and an example of this is her aunt says 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family?'
19321	7	0	That you can tell that she is very upset in a way.
19322	7	0	Rose tends to build up things and when she had an internal conflict going on in thats really bothering her, she takes it out on everyone around her. Such as when she got mad at her sister.

19327	7	0	Anna seems like she is a very responsible girl. Even though she has alot of stress to deal with, such as a job and an essay, she still keeps going for the good of her family. This also shows that she is loving and careing toward her family.

19329	7	0	courage
19330	7	0	Rose thinks that money is basically everything and that it the only thing that gets you by in life. This is what she tells Anna when Anna tells her that money is not everything.
19331	7	2	Comforting          I believe that Rose is very comforting.  She trys her hardest to provide for her family. Even though she is in school she also has a job.  Also in paragraphs four through nine Rose trys to comfort her little sister Anna.  During this conversation Anna becomes resentfl and leaves but Rose did have a motherly instinct and did try to comfort her.
19332	7	0	Rose is very independent and only wants to help everyone else. She doesn't let anyone know how she really feels about things because she doesn't want to bother them or she wants to protect them. She tries explaining to Anna that their dad had to move to Los Angeles because he got paid three times the amount of before and they needed the money to support the family. She tries saying it in a nice way to protect her sister from feeling lonely and like no one cares about her.
19333	7	0	smart with a great imagination but she is troubled

19341	7	1	In Rose's conversation with Anna we see that Rose really wants what's best for her family by telling Anna that their father had to take the job in Los Angeles to help them with money and that they all have to do their part.
19342	7	0	One trait that describes Rose based on a conversation with her sister is that she is an over workedr. This is because, she has fallen asleep trying desperatly to find even a topic for her eassy. She had work all day at her job and she was tired of being stressed out. She delt with every thing that went on that day by taking her frustrations on her sister. She only wnat to have it easier when she says, 'and he'll pay for me to go to callage.
19343	7	0	she fills like she is responsible.

19350	7	1	She is a very hard working girl. She has worked very hard for a long time. She also plans on working more.
19351	7	2	She trys to keep everyone happy. She didn't want to worry her little sisterd so she tried to make humor of the situation. 'She tried a laugh that sounded gake even to her.' She knew it stank that her dad was away and that they weren't financially stable. Even though she worried about her she didn't want her sister to.     She always said to her sister, Anna, He'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' It didn't sound convincing to Anna and you know that because it states in the reading that she's already heard that from their mother. Rose just trys to be optimistic.     When she talks to her Aunt, her Aunt asks if she felt weighed down by all the work she's doing for the family, even though the anser is yes she doesnt want to say so because she doesnt want her family to feel bad.
21752	8	1	Paul is a little surprised at what he finds and seems a little upset that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his accomplishment. Paul asks Mr. Leonard about his past and what happened to his track carrer.
21753	8	1	It helps paul understand him better and why he did what he did. It helps him connect with him.
21754	8	2	He was surprised to find out that they had something in common, they can't read the best. 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.
21755	8	2	The effect of the background information on Paul was that saw that Mr. Leonard was just like him. Paul states in the story ' The emotions in Mr. Leonard wards were all to familiar to me.', Paul says this after Mr. Leonard stated ' No other school wanter a runner who couldn't read.'.
21756	8	2	I believe that it made him realize that he was just like Mr. Leonard. The fact is that they are both a like in many way's in the way that they act. They both can not read very well. They both are sorta shy. I believe that these two people can make the best of friends. The effect that it has Paul is a great deal because he realizes alot about Mr. Leonard in how much they are a like. In all they both cant read very well at all. They are both good at track. This is why the background information has such effect on him.
21757	8	1	The effect of Mr. Leonard's background affects Paul, because he didn't know anything about all that stuff until he asked Mr. Leonard himself. He basically looked up to Mr. Leonard, and he wanted to be able to show him that he can get better at his reading just like jumping hurdles.
21758	8	1	It helps Paul because he now knows that he is not the only one who struggles to read. This background information makes Paul believe that he can also make it trough high school and college.
21759	8	2	Paul realizes that he could give Mr. Leonard something that he couldn't have as a college athlete. He realized that he could make something of himself, with all the help he is recieving, by coaching or teaching help.
21760	8	2	In beginning of the story Paul has to go to the Learning Center for help in reading. Then Mr. Leonard finds him and turns him into an athlete, to run hurdles. After Paul sees what Mr. Leonard was he asked him what happened and Mr. Leonard told him. Learning about his reading problems really helped him relate to him. He understood. So in the end he says, 'it is time to start your training.'
21761	8	0	When i got to met Mr .Leonard is when i started middle school.
21762	8	0	The both of them have similar problems. Mr Leonard can't read, just like Paul. Both Paul and Mr. Leonard like hurdling.
21763	8	0	Mr. Leonard couldn't read in high school but was good at sports. Paul couldn't read and he wasn't very good at sports.
21764	8	2	Paul learns backround information about Mr. Leonard throughout the story.  This helps him to know that they are 'in the same boat'.  They both struggle with, reading in life, but they figure out how to put it behind themselves and turn to something else.     Mr. Leonard ran track in school and went to run in college, but his trouble with reading lead him to quit everything.  Paul, who is trying to improve upon his reading, turns to track to help him in general to just have something to turn to.       Both Mr. Leonard and Paul learn that they both have obstecles in their life, but they learn to deal with them and go on and live their lives.
21765	8	1	He is confused as to why, as a freshman in a college, a nationalist champion is a hall monitor at a high school. He could have gone on to bigger and beter things. He is also wondering why he would even bother with a kid who can't read and one day asked him to train with him. He is also probably wondering why he didnt tell him about his past, but as Mr. Leonard tells him about his past, he understands why he is doing this for him and why he cares so much.
21766	8	0	It has an affect on Paul to where he doesnt go around Mr. Leonard and Paul will not get any of his work done aroeud the.
21767	8	1	It has inspired him to try his best and always stirive for excellence. He doesn't want to let him down by not doing well.
21768	8	1	The information that Mr. Lenonrd's tells Paul shows that they are really alike in ways, so they feel closer.
21769	8	1	The information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard lifted up Paul's spirits. He did not feel as bad anymore that he could not read. He just had to try harder to succeed at what he wanted to do. It was inspirational.
21770	8	1	The Narrator is shocked about what he finds and wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his great achievement. The hole reason why Mr. Leonard wanted the Narrator to look at his background information was so that he could see that not only talent can get you through life. He wanted the Narrator to see that you also need an education. for example, he says 'I was a good athelete, but not a good student.'
21771	8	0	The affect that Paul has on the background information about Mr.Leonard is that when he told Paul he lost his scholarship he had flunked out. 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' that was what Mr.Leonard had told paul. Also when he got stopped in the hallway Mr.Leonard asked him where he was going and he looked at the pass but didn't know if Paul was telling the truth. Paul found out at that point he didn't know how to read.
21772	8	2	It effects Paul because he has been training with a person who broke track records in college. It made Paul want to work hard.
21773	8	2	Paul was shocked to hear that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he was always knew everything about sports. and when he found out he couldnt read well that also shocked Paul.
21774	8	2	The it has on paul is that he and Mr.Leonard have similart storiers in terms of preformance in education. Paul relizing that education is importnat, he dovotes himself to both education and track. Mr.Leonard story inspired paul to do well in school so he does not fluck out like Mr.Leonard did.
21775	8	0	that they both wasnt good at school but was very talented in sports
21776	8	1	Paul is susprised about the information he learned and confused, he says 'why didn't you tell me about this?'
21777	8	0	The background information of Mr.Leonard was a hall monitor the job was to keep students moveing along, to class room to clazz room. The background infromation for Paul is he dont think he that good at sports
21778	8	2	The information that Mr. Leonard had reading troubles which stopped him from succeeding helped Paul to understand why he was helping him out.  Also, it gave Paul a chance to understand Mr. Leonards curiosity in him, and gave Paul a chance to help him out.
21779	8	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike. Paul said that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to him. The feeling of Paul's embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know and answer everyone else knew, was just like what Mr. Leonard had felt.
21780	8	2	The background information on of Mr.Leonard has encouraged Paul to do well. I think he feels that if he can get good at track he can do anything he sets his mind to.At first Paul was suprised and honored to know that Mr. Leonard had went to college for track and after he finds out he cant read he feels sorry for him but at the same time he can relate to his story.
21781	8	1	When Paul gets backgroung information on Mr.Leonard he has a new respect for Mr.Leonard that he didn't have before. When he first finds out about Leonards past he isn't angry for not recieving the truth, but paul is eager to help Mr.Leonard achieve his obstacles in return for helping him achieve his own obstacles.
21782	8	2	That pepeole might be more like you than you think and you can lern form them.'The emotins of Mr. lenerds words we to famililar' This show that he felt like he culd relate to him becouse he gose though simailr things.
21783	8	2	Paul is in awe of Mr. Leonard when he sees that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that he broke records. He is kind of confused as to why Mr. Leonard stopped doing track until Mr. leonard tells him it was because of his poor reading skill.
21784	8	0	Mr. Leonard stops everyone on the stairwell. He wants to help Paul fine a sport that he can play. Mr. Leonard whats Paul to play track and now he is tranning. Mr. Leonard dont know how to read so Paul helps him.
21785	8	0	Mr leonard is a good techer he helps his stoodints out all the time.he tooke his time out of his day to help this kid that needs help on his home work.
21786	8	2	Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past, it surprised him that Mr. Leonard was a bad reader just like he was. The information makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard just like he had helped him before.
21787	8	2	The effect on Paul after reading the background information on Mr.Leonard was shocking. He couldnt believe that he used to do hurdles. He was concerned and interested in knowing about his experience and what happened as he questioned Mr.Leonard. He asked him what happened after that and Mr.Leonard explained how he was in the same situation as Paul but back then they didn't have a Learning Center. People told him that he would get a scholarship and not to worry about his grades so he just got by from his friends helping him which eventually didn't work for colllege because it's way harder. He ended up flunking out and no other school wanted him. Paul felt that since Mr.Leonard was helping him that he would help Mr.Leonard. So as the story ends he is going to help Mr.Leonard learn how to read.
21788	8	1	The background information which Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard definately has an effect on Paul's feelings for his new coach.  Unlike before, Paul now feels a connection with Mr. Leonard in that they each have gone through similar struggles.  By being able to relate to one another's strengths and weaknesses, their relationship will surely change, in a positive manner.
21789	8	0	Paul had this stuff happen to him to so he's trying to fix it and do better then Mr. Leonard. Also he is learning to be good in sports aswell. Also he want s to make Mr. Leonard to be happy.
21790	8	2	With this information Paul gets he kind of in a way makes a new friend and learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star but can't read like himself. These two people relate together because they both can't read to well.
21791	8	1	Paul is more intrested in track and ask Mr. Leonard if he should start working out with the high school team. Paul and Mr. leonard both have the same learning problem the only differnce is that paul can get help and Mr. Leonard couldn't.

21918	8	1	It teaches Paul an important lesson that working hard in school is imortant. It tells him that if you are not properly educated then you will be held back from doing what you want to do in the future. When the coach tells the kid he flunked out of college this tells Paul the importance of knowledge.

He has an eagerness to learn from Mr. Leonard, both athletically and in how to handle situations that present themselves in life. Paul also shows a willingness to teach. Even though he himself cannot read, he still is trying to urge Mr. Leonard to learn to read with him.
22004	8	2	The background information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard help support him to do the best he can.'It's time to start your training.'
22005	8	2	Once Paul had checked out the website Mr. Leonard told him about he was curious to why he didnt tell him that he was a college track star. Since Paul came back the next day knowing that information about Mr. Leonard, it was obvious to Mr. Leonard that Paul learned how to read.     This also makes there relationship better because they both had similar problems that they overcame. Paul joined the track team, and at the very end Paul offered Mr. Leonard a reading lesson.
22006	8	2	It motivates him to work harder in school.  He wants to succeed at track but to do that he needs to succeed academically as well.  It allows him to empathize with Mr. Leonard.  They both have experienced embarassment on account of their reading disability. This causes Paul not only to want to do better in school and track but also to help Mr. Leonard overcome his reading disability just like he helped Paul overcome his lack of athletic skill.
22007	8	2	When Mr. Leonard says 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out', it says Paul feels like 'Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me.'. Paul then connected with him, because Mr. Leonard is going through the same ordeal as Paul. Then starts their friendship.
22008	8	1	The background information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to help him on his reading skills. Mr. Loenard helped Paul so Paul decides to help him in return.
22009	8	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was an amazing track star and was an awful reader like himself. Paul also found out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because the track team didn't want someone who could not read. This discourages Paul because this is a very similar situation that he could go through. In a way Paul feels comfortable because he knows that he's not alone in this because he has Mr. Leonard by his side.
22010	8	2	He was shocked that he had a college all star in track teaching him and he also didnt understand why he hadnt said anything about it. Wonce he finds out what he happended to him he wants to help and said its time to start his trianing by teaching him to read.
22011	8	0	It has a conetion with how paul is now in high school.
22012	8	2	He completely understands how he feels. He said he knew what it was like when he felt embarrassed when he was called upon to real aloud or when he did not know an answer everyone else knew. Mr. Leonard trained with him and made him better at hurdling. He soon realized he could teach Mr. Leonard how to read, so he started his training.
22013	8	2	The effect that the background reading has on paul is empathy. Paul knows how mr. Leonard feels because paul has problems reading too. paul shows this empathy when he says 'The emotions of Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me..... feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud.' the information shows paul that hes not alone and that he can make a difference on Mr. Leonard by helping him to learn how to read like Mr. Leonard had taught him how to hurdle.
22014	8	2	Paul is subjected to training from Mr. Leonard after school on track and field. This opens up questions as to why Mr. Leonard is a janitor when he clearly knows alot about track and field. These questions open up more ideas as to why Mr. Leonard would help Paul. When Paul discovers the truth to Mr. Leonard's background he is astonished that he was trained by someone that was top notch in track and field.
22015	8	2	Mr. Leonard was a track star, but he could not keep up in school.  He flunked out of college because he could not read. Paul realizes he needs to be able to read to be sucsesful.
22016	8	2	The information about Mr. Leonard's background encourages Paul. At first Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him in the first place, but then he realizes that Mr. Leonard is only trying to help him avoid the mistakes that he made. Mr. Leonard is pleased by Paul's efforts to improve his reading because it could prevent him from losing the opportunities that Mr. Leonard did.
22017	8	2	I think that the information Paul has found about Mr. Leonard effected him in different ways. I do beilieve that Paul was shocked to have found out that Grabowski had set many records in hurdles, but i also think he had to have known Mr. Leonard knew what he was doing. I think that Paul was very sympathtic and understanding when he found out Leaonard could not read. The effect it had on Paul most likely gave him hope toward himself. The fact that Paul is offering to teach Mr. Leonard to read at the end of the story shows that Mr. Leonard had effected him in a positive way.
22018	8	2	In this story the main character, Paul, can't read. Mr. Leonard stopped him in the hallway almost every day when Paul was on his way to the learning center, Mr. Leonard would just glance at his pass and let him go. Eventually, when Mr. Leonard decides to start training Paul on the hurtles, Paul starts getting really good at hurtles and running. Paul was talking with the high school track coach and the coach told him to look at the track and field website, when Paul found Mr. Leonard as one of the past athletes he was shocked. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he was once in college but he had to drop out because he could not read.      I think that since Paul cannot read, this information about Mr. Leonard is very inspiring to him in a sense. Paul realizes he can make it to college but he needs to keep trying unlike Mr. Leonard. Paul has a lot in common with Mr. Leonard and I think that is inspiring.
22019	8	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard succeed at reading like Mr. Leonard helped him suceed at hurtles.
22020	8	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard has an inspirational effect on Paul.  This is shown in paragraph forty-five when Paul relates his situation of not being able to read well to Mr. Leonard's situation.  Mr. Leonard noticed that and decided to help Paul become a good athlete.  So Paul returned the favor and is going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
22021	8	1	It helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard helped him with the training more. It also gives Paul an idea on how to help Mr. Leonard as a payback.
22022	8	0	It kinda made him disappointed becuase Mr. Leonard never told him anything abou thow good of an athlete he was. Mr. Leonard also never told him that he could't read either.
22023	8	0	That he was a track star in collige.
22024	8	0	It helped because its information and any information normally helps or clears things up.
22025	8	2	The background information just makes Paul want to make Mr.Leonard a better person. He (Paul) felt as if he should be able to help him out since Mr.Leonard helped him out by making him a better runner. So he feels inspired to help him learn/ work on how to read.
22026	8	2	The information tells you that Paul and Mr.Leonard are alike. They are both poor students who is not the good of readers. That why Mr. Leonard ask Paul to do the hurdles. He and Paul are alike. If they do something, they work there hardest they will achieve anything.
22027	8	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard struggled with reading when he was a young boy. Mr. Leonard went to college and was an amazing runner and all through school he was told that his grades did not matter, that he would have tutors to help him. One day, he realized that college was harder than high school. He lost his scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul realized that Mr. Leonard's word were all too familiar. He new the feeling of not being able to read. He knew that learning to read was very important.
22028	8	1	It inspires him to help Mr.Leonard with his reading just as Mr.Leonard has helped him with track and field. He feels inspired so since Mr. Leonard has helped him he thought it would be nice to give Mr.Leonard some help too.
22029	8	2	The effect of learning about Mr. Leonard's background is that he gains the knowledge that even the most seemingly successful people can suffer from similar struggles to him, and that even the people he respects can use help from others.
22030	8	2	The background infromation that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard effects him by showing him others go through the same thing and that hes not alone. Pqul also feels the same emotion of embarassment as Mr. Leonard did and he then realized he could help him out to.
22031	8	2	The effect that this background information of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is somewhat overwhelming for Paul.  He probably cannot believe he has been working out with such an outstanding star and athlete.  When Paul finds out why Mr. Leonard loses his scholarship, he feels bad for him.  This only encourages Paul more though.  He realizes that Mr. Leonard did not have the programs that kids today do, and with Mr. Leonard showing how much he cares about him.  Paul will be taking full advantage of those programs to learn to read better and become a much better student.
22032	8	2	The information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard affects him because he can relate to his story very easily because they both can't read. It also motivates Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
22033	8	0	Mr.Leonard tells Paul that he used to jump over the hurdels in college and Paul has enough confidents that he could do it to.
22034	8	2	The background information that Paul finds on the website given to him, causes him to have a common ground with Mr. Leaonard. Since Mr. Leonard stuggled with reading as well and did extrememly well in Track.
22035	8	2	At first Paul is excited to learn he has been training with a track star. Then he realizes that Mr.Leonard has given him a gift, of track, and when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard can't read paul gives him the gift of reading.
22036	8	1	It lets Paul know that he isn't the only one who has problems reading. Mr Leonard said that he wasn't a good student and that is why he lost his scholarship and flunked out. Paul said that he knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called up on and didn't know the answer or told to read aloud.
22037	8	0	Paul is effected by the discovery because he has the same problem that the janitor has. Paul understands how the janitor feels and wants to know more about the janitor's life in college and why he is not still running today.
22038	8	1	The effect of finding out the background of Mr. Leonard on Paul is that he wants to help him learn how to read like Mr. Leonard helped him how to jump hurdles better.
22039	8	0	The background information he gets bothers him because he doesnt know if he can add up to all of it ti impress him.
22040	8	2	Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was such a great athlete. When Mr. Leonard told him, 'I was a great athlete, but not a good student,' Paul knew what Mr. Leonard was doing. Paul understaood that Mr. Leonard was in the same situation as him and he wanted to help him as much as he could. Try and get Paul to understand that he can build his confidence. To be a good student and be the good athlete also.
22041	8	2	The background information had a great effect on Paul in the story because Paul learning that Mr. Leonard couldn't read just like Paul it motivated him to try harder to excel at running hurdles as well as school work. 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' This quote proves my point that after learning background information on Mr. Leonard, Paul was ready to get better at track and school.
22042	8	2	He listens more to what Mr. Leornard has to say. Also, in paragraphs thirty-three down to fourty-five, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but flunked out of college. This fact got Paul to work harder at hurdles and help Mr. Leonard.
22043	8	2	After learning the background information of Mr. Leonard, the effect it has on Paul changes his views. Paul learns Mr. Leonard was a great athlete that even broke records his freshman year of college. When Paul learns Mr. Leonard flunked out, he can't imagine why. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to know that an athletic career might get him a scholarship, but won't save him embaressment if he doesn't know how to read. After Paul learns Mr. Leonard is still embaressed that he can't read, Paul wants to repay Mr. Leonard with the same confidence he gave to Paul. Paul takes the initiative to in turn, train Mr. Leonard in reading, as Mr. Leonard has trained Paul to have confidence in both reading and life.
22044	8	0	Paul probably felt special when he found out that Mr. Leonard has broken national records in hurdling and wanted to train him.  He must have felt like Mr. Leonard cared about him.
22045	8	1	Paul feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard, because they both share the same problem. This is evident when Paul says 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's voice were all too familiar to me', after Mr. Leonard explains his troubles with reading.
22046	8	1	they both had something in common. they both couldnt read and they wanted to do sports. The only reason the teacher wanted to help the kid was because he wanted to play in a sport when he was young but he couldnt because he couldnt read.
22047	8	0	he wants to be good at track.
22048	8	2	He has more respect for the lessons Leonard is teaching him because he finds out Leonard was a track star so he probably knows what he is doing.
22049	8	1	in the story paul gets information on the mr. leonard and this effects paul in good way because this is an insperation to paul to go after what he wants
22050	8	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard has a great effect on Paul.  He has many emotions going through his head because he realizes that he is a younger version of Mr. Leonard.  He thinks about how he knows the feelings Mr. Leonard felt.  Since Mr. Leonard helps him so much on hurdles, he is going to help him read.  The fact that Mr. Leonard had never gotten the remediation that Paul was getting in school now, makes Paul even more motivated.
22051	8	2	Paul understands that Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul acheieve in something else. Mr. Leonard was at the time where he didnt have what Paul has. Mr. Leonard relied on friends to help him get by. Paul works harder now becuase collage scouts told Mr. Leonard that grades didnt matter but the real truth was that they did. Mr. Leonard flunked out because collages didnt want a runner that couldn't read.
22052	8	2	Learning about Mr. Leonard's past made Paul understand that someone understood how he felt. In lines 45-47, Paul says that he and Mr. Leonard both feel the same way about their reading issues. He also realized that he could return Mr. Leonards generosity and in line 46 implies that he will do this by teaching Mr. Leonard how to read.  Paul became more motivated by Mr. Leonard's story, both about running the hurdles and learning to read.
22053	8	2	Paul wonders what happened to Mr. Leonard that would have him ending up being a janitor and when he finds out Mr. Leonard flunked out of college it helps him remember that he needs to learn how to read well. The narrator doesn't want to feel embarrassed anymore and seeing Mr. Leonard and finding out about his past makes it feel even more crucia; for him to learn to read so he can better himself in life because only he can decide his future and it helps him realize that now that he has the tools to suceed, he should help Mr. Leonard out too.
22054	8	2	The background information has an empathetic effect on Paul. He realises that Mr. Leonard has had a hard life and that he didn't get to do what he wanted to do. Paul starts to feel the need to help Mr. Leonard back, by helping him to learn to read.
22055	8	2	The information helps Paul realize what he can achieve if he works hard. Mr. Leonard was and excellent athlete but not a good student so he was given a scholorship for track and field even though he did not recieve good grades. He later flunked out of college because he did not earn good grades by not worrying about them. He wants Paul to work hard and learn how to read so he does not have to go through what he did. It shows Paul how to get over obstacles.
22056	8	0	That Paul is geting helped in the spots he want to get better at, and Mr. Leonard is geting helped in his reading.
22057	8	0	It shows that even some of the most talented kids have problems in show area of their life. In the story Mr. Leonard can not read which showed Paul that everyone has problems.
22058	8	1	Paul feels sorry for Mr. Leonard. HE felt he had to do something to thank Mr. Leonard for helping him be good at something.
22059	8	1	The information that Paul gets tells him that Mr. Leonard is just like him.
22060	8	2	When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a record breaking college hurdler he is surprised.  This makes him wonder why he is pushing him to be an athlete, which he finds out is because Paul and Mr. Leonard are almost the same person but at different points in their lives.
22061	8	0	paul is difrrent from them becaus he thinks that hes better then the other people and that he only knows how to do things his way and thats how its going to be he also thinks that he can do anything in life whitch is not like that you have to learn from it and then experice what you been throught after alking about it. he acts more like a kid trying to remmember that happen during his child hood back then and trying to interact with other people acepting him because of who ihe is not because of how he look aae
22062	8	2	When paul finds out Mr. Leonard was an old track star he wanted to know why he didnt tell him. Then he asked why he stopped. Mr. Leonard was embrassed to say that he had got kicked out of college because he couldn't read, and his grades weren't there.  Paul knew what it felt like to not be able to read. Since Mr. Leonard was there to help him become better, Paul said ' It's time to start your training'. Saying that he was going to teach him to read.
22063	8	1	Before Paul went up to Mr. Leonard, the effect of the information on Paul is that maybe he could be as good as him. The effect on Paul after comfronting Mr. Leonard, was that since Mr. Leonard was teaching Paul what he knows about hurdling, Paul could teach Mr. Leonard what he knows about reading.
22064	8	2	When Paul researched Mr. Leonard, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt share his past with him. Paul didn't understand why Mr. Leonard would keep his track achievements a secret. Paul was shocked and confused. Paul said 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.'  Mr. Leonard replied, 'I remeber, best race of my life.' Then Paul asked himwhat had happened.
22065	8	0	Paul gets what he wants to do by Mr. Leonard because he want to be just like him so he strted in track which the teacher was Mr. Leonard.
22066	8	0	It made Paul curious of why Mr. Leonard didn't still run track.
22067	8	1	After hearing the success and the downfall of Mr.Leonard, Paul realizes that he has to keep his-self motivated, so he can reach success. Paul took Mr.Leonard's story to heart, you can imply this due to Paul's last sentence of the text 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training'. I believe that Paul was going to help Mr.Leonard on his reading skills, becuase he helped him on his track skills.
22068	8	2	Just as Paul is finding all of the background information on Mr. Leonard, he is beginning to realize that he too can agree and relate to him because they both have that in common where reading and speaking aloud in the classroom is and always has been a struggle for them. They have both looked for help in the learning center so they could finally become a better reader and be better at something in school. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me'. 'I knew them well, feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  Paul knew the feeling, he shared the exact same struggle with Mr Leonard.
22069	8	1	It shows Paul that he needs to overcome is difficulties.  He sees that Mr. Leonard could have had a much better life if he had been able to keep up with the work as well as the running.  Paul realizes that he should help Mr. Leonard with his difficulties.
22070	8	0	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in his college days. He wonders why Mr. Leonard quit running track if he was so good at it. Paul confronts Mr. Leonard and finds out that he had flunked out of college because he never learned how to read. We find out in the beginning of the story that Paul goes to the learning center twice a day to learn how to read. Paul finds out through this experience that grades are important when it comes to college. You may be good at sports, but if you don't know how to read, you won't be able to play sports because you may flunk out of college. Paul realizes that he is lucky to have found a companion like Mr. Leonard to teach him a very valuable lesson about life.
22071	8	2	Paul most likely feels like he can relate more to Mr. Leonard. He knows that they both have a difficult time reading. He feels like there is a kind of connection beween the two of them. He knows that they both struggled with the same thing, and he figures if Mr. Leonard can help him gain confidence and be good at something, he can help him learn how to read.
22072	8	2	The background information that Paul got motivated him to put MR. Leonard through training to teach him how to read because Mr. Leonard helped him to become a track runner. He knows the embarrassing feelings that Mr. Leonard must have felt and now wants to help him overcome his problems.
22073	8	0	It show very little about the brackground for paule !
22074	8	1	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard effects him because, Mr. Leonard helped him overcome his differances, so he wants to help Mr. Leonard with his. Together they make a good team.
22075	8	1	The effect it has on Paul is kind of shocking to him. When Paul gets the background about Mr. Leonard he was appauled. He was shocked that he seen that Mr. Leonard has all the records for the hurdles. But when Paul was talking to Mr. Leonard he had no idea that he had dropped out of college and stopped playing sports because of his grades. So the effect that it had on Paul is that he knew that Mr. Leonard knew what kind of struggles he was having. And thats all that Mr. Leonard wanted to do was to help him through it.
22076	8	0	We learn through this passage that Paul can't read and that he recieves help for it. When Mr. Leonard was a student, he didn't try to get help for not being able to read, and in the end, he flunked out of a college and is now a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard is trying to tell Paul that if he doesn't start to learn how to read, no matter how good he is at something, college won't take him. He is also trying to show him how important reading can be.
22077	8	1	Mr. Leonard also had problems with reading in school as it mentions that he could not read in college.  This gives Mr. Leonard and Paul something in common.  Ultimately, it is an encouragement for Paul to continue on with school and track.
22078	8	1	The effect it has on Paul is he gets confused and then encouraged because he can train Mr. Leonard.
22079	8	0	Mr. Leonard reveals how he was an amazing runner in high school, but he wasn't a good student he found school hard and flunked out of college. Mr Leonard saw himself in the narrator and thats why he helped him so that the narrator could have a better more successful future with college, jobs, and sports what he didn't have.

22082	8	1	The background information effects paul in a good way. The background information shows Paul that he needs to do good in school stay in track. It also shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was a great track star, and I think that would affect paul positively.
22083	8	0	When Paul discovered the background information about Mr. Leonard, he was suspicious to why he was never told about his achievements in track and field.  Paul also wondered how he could have been so good, yet ended up as a hall monitor.  This caused Paul to confront Mr. Leonard about it.
22084	8	1	Paul is intrigued and asks Mr. Leonard what happened in paragraph 40.  Mr. Leonard's story inspired Paul a lot because he too struggled with academics as well as reading.
22085	8	0	Paul realizes that the man is trying to help him. The man used his own time to help paul to get better at something.
22086	8	2	He believes that if Mr. Leonard was a poor reader but could excel at track, he could too. He feels like he and Mr. Leonard have a lot in common and begins to feel a connection with him.
22087	8	0	It makes him want to show him that he can do his best and show how much he has help him.
22088	8	2	The effect of the background information Paul gets from the URL the high school track coach gives him is fairly great. Knowing that Mr.Leonard was a poor student and couldnt read just like paul is now brought them closer together. This is strongly supported in the last two sentences.
22089	8	2	Once Paul realized that Mr. Leonard suffered the same difficulties with literacy that he himself struggles with, Paul has a new sympathy for Mr. Leonard. Paul, appreciative of the effort Mr. Leonard is putting into helping him overcome his troubles, decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to do what troubled him in his college years. Their shared difficulty with learning to read gives them a similar perspective and allows each to sympathize and assist in any way they can.
22090	8	2	Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard was an incredible athlete but a terrible student. The information caused Paul to feel empathy toward Mr. Leonard because Paul is in the same situsation that Mr. Leonard had been when he was a student.  Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul become a better athlete and a better student by motivating him on the track field, and it works. Because of Paul's empathy towards Mr. Leonard, he is inspired to aide Mr. Leonard in his reading studies.
22091	8	2	It gives Paul respect for the man who went through the same experience Paul is going through now.  He felt Mr. Leonard's emotions were familiar.  He knew that Mr. Leonard started training him to make Paul feel better about himself, just as he had so many years ago.  Paul felt he should return the favor, and is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.

22095	8	1	I think that the background information that paul found about Mr. leonard had a suprising effect on him. He was questioning how Mr. Leonard did not know his name when he checked his hall pass twice a week.
22096	8	2	The effect that the backgroud information has on Paul is that its going to help him to succed in his career in the future. when he foud out that Mr.leonard was a college freshman athlete that raced in the 400 metter hurdles and he won nationals he was surpriced that Mr.leonard  had accomplished that.But Paul asked why he had stoped his career in track and Mr.leonard told him he was really good at track but he had a hard time learning and reading that they had give him the wrong advice. Paul is compared to Mr.leonadr in the way that both of them have a hard time learning but they are really good in the same sport. Mr.leonar dis helping Paul realize to study ahrd and he would accmplish many things in life like how he learned how to jump hurdles.It was going to be the same with school is like a hurdle you have to practice to accomplish thing in life.
22097	8	2	In the story Paul gradually gathers information about Mr. Leonard. At fisrst, this information makes Paul suspicious of Mr. Leonard.  He asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him.  When Mr. Leonard explains his reasons, Paul is understanding and decides to help Mr. Leonard.  This background information makes Paul realize what he can do to help Mr. Leonard.
22098	8	0	The information that has on Paul is what the story is telling us.
22099	8	2	According to the story, the background about Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a very positive way. Paul sees how good Mr. Leonard could have been at track, so that motivates him to keep working hard in school and in track. In the story, when Paul says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.', that shows the readers what Mr. Leonard means to Paul. Mr. Leonard's was a lot like Paul when he was a boy, and that has an effect on Paul. Paul now wants to strive forward and be the best he can be.

22103	8	1	Paul is like Mr. Leonard, they both struggle with school work but are good at other things. Paul didn't realize until after he had already been training with Mr. Leonard for quite some time. Then he felt even closer and somewhat connected with him.

22105	8	2	When he was told that Mr. Leonard had been a college track star I think that made him open his eyes a little wider and relize who he was working with after he went to that URL. ' you were a college freshemen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals'. you broke records'. when he saw that then he relized that he wasnt jsut working with a hall monitor he was working with a star.
22106	8	2	The background information effected Paul by showing him you can be anything. Paul thought Mr. Leonard was just another janitor, but he wasn't. In the story Paul shows excitement when he talked about Mr. Leonard breaking records and winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul had the effect of someone he could look up to and learn from. When Mr. Leonard told Paul he couldn't read, Paul told him it was his turn to train. Paul was happy to have a coach who did something great in his past. Paul realized you can't ever judge a book by its cover because you never know whats in the pages.
22107	8	2	Paul was suprised to know that he had been training with a college track star that broke records on a national level. The reader can tell he was shocked when the narrator say, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Then the narrator asks him what had happend and was suprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had the same problem that Paul had.
22108	8	2	Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard never told him about this and Paul finds himself relating to his story because Paul is not a good reader and neither is Mr. Leonard. This story about Mr. Leonard doesnt really discourage Paul but he finds himself wanting to help Mr. Leonard the same way he helped him.
22109	8	0	Paul did not know that Mr. Leonard was a track star in collage. Then he found out that Mr. Lleonard failed out because he could not understand the classes. Mr. leonard could see him self in Paul; he knew that he could do good in track.
22110	8	2	It encourages him. Then he wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
22111	8	2	The narrarator received background information from the track coach about Mr. Leonard Grabowski.  Mr. Grabowski was a record breaking hurdles runner back in the day, but at college his grades were so poor that he lost his scholarship and flunked out.  Due to his disability to read properly he had lost it all.       When the narrarator asked Mr. Grabowski about his past the narrarator saw similar emotions to what he was going through when he got embarrased as he struggled at reading aloud or when he didn't know the answer that everyone else in his class knew.  The narrartor completely understood why Mr. Leonard was embarrased by his past.
22112	8	0	It confuses Paul because Mr. Leonard was so good at track, he didn't know why he stopped running.  Paul askes Mr. Leonard why he stopped running.
22113	8	2	He learns about him breaking records in college, and being amazing at track. This changes his view on Mr. Leonard. I think this makes him respect him more. When he finds out about his reading struggle, this allows him to relate with Mr. Leonard.
22114	8	2	The background information that Paul gets on Mr.Leonard helps encourage Paul to keep going and to learn and to teach Mr.Leonard how to read. Mr.Leonard said 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' Paul said at the evnd 'C'mon Mr. Leonared Its time to start your trainging.'
22115	8	2	Paul relates to Mr. Leonard's story because Paul couldn't read either. In paragraph 6, Paul states that he goes to the learning center because he can't read, and in paragraph 44, Mr. Leonard states that he was an exceptional athlete that could not read. Also, hearing this story has changed Paul because he wants to be able to give back to Mr. Leonard what the hall monitor gave to him. He does this by telling Mr. Leonard to come with him to start his training in reading (paragraph 46).
22116	8	1	It has an effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problem that he did in school they both could not read well. Paul knows how he feels and Mr. Leonard knows how he feels so they both will help each other out and listen to each other.
22117	8	2	Paul understands what Mr. Leonard went through because Paul is in the same situation as he was. Paul feels that since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track that he must help him learn to read.
22118	8	2	The background information helps Paul better relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul has reading problems just as Mr. Leonard does and he feels like he is more welcomed by someone that has the same problem as him. In my opinion, Paul is glad to finally have someone empathetic of his situation.
22119	8	1	Paul feels he has somethings in common with Mr. Leonard. When Paul told Mr. Leonard about the website, Mr. Leonard tells paul that he was a good runner but that he didn't know how to read. the emotions in Mr. Leonard were all too familiar with Paul. He knew the embarrassment of not knowing how to read.
22120	8	1	The information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard on motivates him to do better. For example, when Paul is told to go to the URL website and then comes back the next day to ask Mr. Leonard if he sould work out with the team. Mr. Leonard says, yes. When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard's education and about his college experience, he was motivated to make Mr. Leonard happy by showing him what he could do for him.
22121	8	2	Paul believes since Mr. Leonard is helping him gain confidience that he has to help Mr. Leonard some how. Mr Leonard wants Paul to be able to fill his dreams unlike Mr. Leonard who didn't get that opurtunity.
22122	8	2	After getting all of that background information, Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was trying to make Paul better and that Paul needed to do something for him in return after finding out that Mr.Leonard had flunked out of college and didn't get to finish out his college career.
22123	8	2	Paul knows what Mr. Leonard is going threw, he himself cant read. Mr. Leonard conviences Paul to do track. Mr Leonard was a colloge drop out. He cant read and Paul wants to make him happy.
22124	8	1	The effect that background information has on Paul is the man had given his time to help him excel at something. So Paul realized that he could do something for him as well.
22125	8	0	Both Mr. Leonard and Paul have trouble reading, and they both enjoy running track. Mr. Leonard is a pretty successful guy and he sees that Paul can also be a successful student. Paul is also a great learner and could be helped by Mr. Leonard because they come from the same background. In this case, Mr. Leonard helps Paul with his track and running, while Paul later helps Mr. Leonard read.
22126	8	2	The effect the background information on Mr. Leonard has a profound effect on Paul. It helps Paul to understand why Mr. Leonard did not ask questions after Paul told him where he was going, as is shown in Paragraph 45. Paul can see that Mr. Leonard regrets not having the Learning Center to help him learn to read. This makes Mr. Leonard want to help Paul so Paul doesn't suffer the same consequences. Because of this, Paul can understand why Mr. Leonard treated him the way he did.
22127	8	2	The effect of the background information is understading.  The similarities of Mr. Leonard and Paul give them  a connection that furthurs their relationship.

By them both struggling with reading gives Paul an opprotunity to give back and help Mr. Leonard.
22128	8	0	The effect that the background has on Paul is that both Mr. Leonard and hisself have something in common with each other' which is that neither one of them can read. Paul learns that no one wants a person who can not read.
22129	8	1	In the story the reader learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star, but he struggled with his school studies and could not read. The author says, '' I was a good athlete,' he said softly, 'but not a good student.'' I believe this has a very large impact on Paul. It shows Paul that even though he may stuggle with his school work, he doesn't have to struggle with everything else. It motivates Paul because if Mr. Leonard could break records, he could too. Paul also decided to help Mr. Leonard with his studies because Mr. Leonard helped him jump a hurdle in life.
22130	8	2	The reader finds out that Mr. Leonard is a 400 meter hurdles champion his freshman year of college. Paul was taken by surprise when he realized he was trainning with a champion hurdle star. Paul was pushed in track while trainning with a champion without knowing he was until he was given a website that had Leonard on it!
22131	8	0	It lets Paul be more comfortable with Mr.Leonard because they are one in the same. After Paul finds out about Mr.Leonards reading problems, he then goes on to say 'It's time to start your training' (Line 46) Meaning he is going to start training Mr.Leonard how to be a better reader. This just emphasizes Pauls level of comfortableness and friendship with Mr.Leonard.
22132	8	2	Well it pushes Paul to really work hard.  Paul is wanting to be a great hurdler.  You can tell that in the story when he gets help.  He was getting trained to do well at it.
22133	8	2	In the story Paul finds out that when Mr. Leonard was in school he could read either. Mr. Leonard see's himself in Paul as a kid and wants to help him. It shows Paul even the best athletes, scholars, or anything aren't perfect, just because they are amazing at what they do, doesnt mean they have an easy life outside of that sport, school function, or even job.
22134	8	1	What he trying to say is that as he met him, he kinda liked him and understand him and the work that he's givin him.
22135	8	2	The effect that background info. has on Paul is he now sees Mr. Leonard as an idol and coach. Considering since Mr. Leonard broke records at nationals in his freshman year of college.
22136	8	2	During the story, the reader learn's some of Mr. Leonard's nackround. The effect of that backround information on paul is that at first he doesn't know anything about Mr. Leonard. Paul just thinks that he is a hall monitor to tell students where to go. As the story goes on, Paul starts to learn more about Mr. Leonard and the information starts to incourage Paul. By the end of the story, Pual and Mr. Leonard know enough about each other that Paul takes Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him read as Mr. Leonard helped Paul run hurdles.
22137	8	2	Paul relieved that there are other people out there that has the same learning problems as he does and to know that Mr. Leonard broke a recorded in college for track was amazing to him.
22138	8	2	After finding out the backround information on Mr. Leonard, Paul understands why the older man is helping him and then Paul decides to try and help the older man with his trouble reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped him become a fast runner.

Paul does not know how to read just as Mr. Leonard did not know how to read when he was in school. By Paul realizing that Mr. Leonard was trying to improve him and teach him to continue on, it allowed Paul to feel like he is not alone and other poeple are like him.

22209	8	2	when he finds out Mr. leonard was a track star he wanted to try harder to make him happy, and he feels as if he can do better if Mr. leonard did
22210	8	0	Paul is just a boy and he dose nothing after school. When Mr. Leonard tells him to 'meet me in the gym 2:30' Paul is use to listing to Mr. Leonard and does what he is told. When Paul meets him there is a crowded room with a bunch of kids. They go outside to the track and everday 'for the past week rain or shine they were out there practiceing'. Then Mr. Leanard 'got this scap of paper and handed it to Paul'. When he looked up this name he relized that he was go at track and he knew what he was taking about. Not like the other people that he would listen to.
22211	8	1	When Paul askes the question, 'why didn't you tell me about this?', you can tell that Paul is a feeling a little betrayed. He is also suprised and curious at what else happened to Mr. Leonard. He askes some questions to dig deeper into the story such as, 'Well, what happened after that'?
22212	8	2	Paul is astonished by how Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and how Mr. Leonard had broken records as well, but he then learns how Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his inability to read.  Paul is able to understand how Mr. Leonard feels because Paul was also unable to read when he was in middle school.  This understanding causes Paul to feel sorry for Mr. Leonard, but motivated to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
22213	8	1	Learning Mr. Leonard's background information has a great effect on Paul. As he tells Paul his story, he can tell, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar...' It shows Paul that he needs to try to be a better student, and to put more effort into his school work.
22214	8	2	By knowing who Mr. Leonard is he can trust his coaching a lot more and look up to him. When he found out that he broke records he was anxious and exicted to know what happened. By Mr. Leonard having all those records it really motivated Paul.
22215	8	2	Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard because he had been helping him out and he hadnt even got to finish his dream. Paul decides hes going to do something to help him in return. So hes going to start 'training' Mr. Leonard to read!
22216	8	1	It would probably want to make Paul work harder and achieve goals like learning how to read or being a really good athlete. Details would be how at the end of the story he's going to try and be Mr. Leonard's couch.
22217	8	1	The background information Paul gets from Mr. Leonard when he realizes he cannot read very well makes Paul feel he wants to help Mr. Leonard. He wants to do this because all the effort he put into helping Paul acheive athleticism as well as keeping his good school habits.
22218	8	0	That Paul is good at sports
22219	8	2	because paul is like a younger version of mr. leonard. paul sees what he maybe could become. mr. leonard see's it to. you might be good at a sport but you need to be able to reqad. mr. leonard couldnt do that so he wants paul to succed
22220	8	1	It shocks him an makes him wonder why he quit what he was doing, untill he finds out the truth.
22221	8	0	It has an effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard has kept his past from Paul the whole time he was training him. Paul was probably upset at Mr. Leonard for not telling Paul he was a hurdler in college but his work was to hard for him to be able to stay in college so he flunked out.
22222	8	1	The information that Mr. leonard gives Paul effects him by motivating him to not only work hard in sports, but also work hard in school, because you can not get that far without a good education.
22223	8	2	He knows that Paul goes down to get help on his readin but that doesnt matter to him because all that matter is that he can run fast and they want him on the school track team. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard use to run for the college team and that he broke record Paul did not understand what happened to that. He found out that Mr. Leonard couldnt read just as Paul couldnt so Paul decided that he was going to help him learn how to read.
22224	8	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was the national champion of the 400 meter hurdles when he was in college, but flunked out because he couldn't read. Learning this information motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard, just as Mr. Leonard helped him become involved with a sport. Mr. Leonard didn't just help him jump over hurdles, he helped Paul excel at something because he couldn't excel in reading.
22225	8	2	In this story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a reading problem as well. With the information that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and that he broke records, proves to Paul that no matter what the circumstances are in life, everyone can overcome the hard times and overcome the hurdles in their lives. This information encourages Paaul to do his best and prove he is good enough to be treated like asny other individual.
22226	8	2	You can tell that the information Paul had found about Mr.Leonard made him want to became a better reader because he didn't want to be like him who couldn't read. In paragraph 45 Paul say's 'feelings of embarrasment when I was called upon to read aloud or did know the answer everyone else knew'. By him saying that it show's that he really related to him.
22227	8	1	the background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul concerend about him. It also makes Paul respect him more. One reason why is because Paul decides to train with him. Also Paul wants to take him to the learning center to help him with his reading.
22228	8	0	Paul and Mr. leonard has and had the same problem. paul was always ashaed ABOUT HIS READING DIORDER. HE WASNT VERY GOOD AT ANYTHING OR TRIED OUT FOR ANYTHING. MR. LEONARD HELP PAUL COME OUT HIS SHELL WHEN PAUL FOUND OUT THAT MR. LEONARD HAD A READING PROBLEM.
22229	8	1	He wishes he could have gotten the help the narrator is getting. When he was in college, scouts said dont worry about the grades but he is making sure that the narrator does. Paul is trying to help him so he can do better than what he had done in college.
22230	8	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard shows why he trained Paul.  It shows that because Mr. Leonard wishes that he had done better in school and had focused more on his grades instead of sports.  Because of his past, Mr. Leonard started helping Paul because he did not want him to do the same thing.
22231	8	1	Paul was so shocked to find out Mr. Leonard was a track star.
22232	8	0	The background information will help Paul at track and it will make him want to do something big with his life.
22233	8	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was just like him, and that he is really grateful Mr. Leonard is helping him, so in the end he helps Mr. Leonard.
22234	8	0	Paul has gotten background information from the computer  about mr. Leonard. About his past and how he was a track star. About his college stuff I believe when Paul had looked that up. He gotten happy because mr.Leonard raelly wants Paul to do sports and not be nothing in life.
22235	8	2	When Paul finds the background information on Mr. Leonard, he realizes why the man did not know his name from seeing his hall pass every day.  Paul immediatly feels sympathy for the man because Paul knows exactly how it feels to not understand how to read.  They both tried hard, but sometimes it takes more than that, sometimes it takes a friend.  With someone by your side seemingly impossible tasks can be accomplished.
22236	8	0	Mr. Leonard did not know how to read so dropped out of colledge.
22237	8	2	Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him. He felt bad for Mr. Leonard and he wanted to help him so in the end of the story he does. I think that it also motivated Paul to do better in school too and it was nice for him to be able to relate to someone about his learning diabilities.
22238	8	2	The backround information Paul gets suprises him. He knows that Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but a bad reader just like Pau was. He knows that Mr. Leonard doesn't want Paul to make the same mistakes he did.
22239	8	1	The effect of the background information on Paul, would be that Mr. Leonard used to be in the same postion as Paul is in. He knows what hes going through.
22240	8	2	I think that Paul was surprised and embarassed all at once.  Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was helping him because he was just like him in school, except did the right thing.  Mr. Leonard didn't try at school like Paul or didn't get help from teachers like Paul seeked to do.  I think Paul was also surprised that Mr. Leonard had broken records when he said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 mete hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  I think paul didn't see this coming.  He was shocked that he was being trained by someone who had accompished such amazing tasks.
22241	8	1	The background information that Paul learns gives him sympathy for Mr. Leonard and gives him the courage to do a friendly thing for Mr. Leonard by helping him with his struggles.
22242	8	0	it doesnt reallt have an effect on pau. paul just asked about his past and why mr.leonard did not tell him about it.
22243	8	1	I think it helps paul out more knowing that, someone like Mr. Leonard. Was a very good athete, and then taught paul everything.          Plus, I think it made paul apriciate Leonard more then, just a hall monitor, that helped him out .
22244	8	1	The effect of the backround information on Paul is that it shows him how important it is to work hard, it also shows him that he shouldn't be embarassed about his reading problem because he is not the only one.
22245	8	2	It effects him, because he is the same as Mr. Leonard, in the sense of not being able to read.It also effects because he knows how the embarrasment feels of not being able to read, and the fact the Mr. Leonard 'has given his to help hime eexcel at something'.
22246	8	0	Paul gets background about Mr. Leonard past. Mr. Loenard told Paul about how he co
22247	8	1	At first Paul seemed to be disappointed because Mr. Leonard hid it from him, but he was thinking in his mind that he knew where he was coming from. The embarrassment, and the teasing from other students. He realized that Mr. Leonard helped him excel in something, and so the least he could do was give him something in return.
22248	8	1	Paul found something in commen with Mr. Leonard and that is their problem with reading. Paul knew Mr. Leonard since middle school, who does his job very well. It makes paul more active and found the imporatance of life. Mr. Leonard helped him to pass the obstacles that stopping him to do something he waant to do.
22249	8	2	The background information about Mr. Leonard was shocking to Paul. Paul was shocked to see that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Paul found out later that Mr. Leonard flucked out of college because he could not do the work, because of the lack of help he got in high school. Paul now wants to do the best that he can in school so he can be a track star and also do extremly well in school.
22250	8	2	Paul finds out about Mr.Leonard and it makes him want to try because if he has someone that is that talented help him it will motivate him to do good. Paul trys hard because he wants to show Mr.Leonard that he can do it and that he dont want to get picked last any more when he is playing a sport. Mr. Leonard explains to Paul that you dont just get picked because you are good at a sport you have to know how to read and do math and things like that. Thats why Paul needs to do good in school and not just sports. when Mr. Leonard was in collage he could not go to a learning center because they didnt not have one back then.     Mr.Leonard told Paul to take advatige of the learning center and get the help cause he needs it.
22251	8	1	The information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks him because he never told Paul about his past and why he was so willing to help him become better at something he liked. Mr. Leonard was very helpful to Paul but it never occured to Paul that he was never asked his name until he met him after school at the track because he checked his hall pass twice a week.
22252	8	1	The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone esle knew.
22253	8	2	It has an effect on paul because Mr. Leonard can't read like Paul. They both are good runners and can do herdles, and they both never learned how to read so the were alike.
22254	8	2	The effect on Paul from finding some background information is that Paul is shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard won the 400 Hurdles in sectionals and that Mr. Leonard also broke records. Mr. Leonard was struggling accademicly so once he flunked out no other collage wanted a athalete that could not read.
22255	8	0	The background information tells him that Mr. Leonard was a really good sports player, and that he had made records. Mr. Leonard didn't want to tell Paul about it, because he has had the same experience that Paul had. Paul told him 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' 'What happened after that?' said Paul. Mr. Leonard said 'I was a good athelete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' Mr. Leonard doesn't want Paul thinking he can't acheive something, just because he didn't. He wants him to try real hard. Which is why he decided to help him out.
22256	8	0	My thoughts about the background information may differ ,on one hand I think paul may try to work hard on grades and excel on track but also at the same time he may question himself about what if this happens to me and give up on lreaning how to read better.
22257	8	2	The effact it had on paul was great. It made Paul relate more to Leonard, and encouraged him to do better. When he learns that Leonard can not read, he is encouraged to help his newly found friend out to teach him to read, just as Leonard help him find something the Paul could excell at.
22258	8	0	the backround information about Mr.Leonard says that he was just concernd about paul and who els ever joined the hurdles . Mr. leonard wanted to look out for the students who was on the track and field.
22259	8	2	Paul learns by reading about Mr. Leonard on the website, that he was a great hurdler that broke national records. So he wants to know why Mr. Leonard never mentioned it. When he tells him why, Paul realizes that he is just like him and sees that even though you cant read, you can still succeed.
22260	8	0	It makes Paul want to be good in a sport. He wants to have the fame and glory. He wants Mr. Leonard to teach him how to scuceed in the sport and make him as good as he was.
22261	8	1	During the story, the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard. That effects the background information on Paul because, Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard went through the same phrase as him.
22262	8	1	The background information that Mr. Leonard tells to Paul impacts Pauls life. Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals and broke records. Even though Mr. Leonard was a good athlete he did not get good enough grades to pursue his scholarship and he flunekd out. All the words Mr. Lenoard told Paul were very familiar to him.
22263	8	2	The information that Paul found out about was suprising, because he didn't know anything about Mr. Leonard being good in track. He found it hard to believe he flunked college.
22264	8	0	The information that Mr. Lenonard gives him about college scares him. He doesnt want to fail out of college like they other guy did. He wants to make it in life and make sure that he is successful in all the things to come before him.
22265	8	1	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard  affects the way he sees sports and education. When the narrator says, 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him,' he learns that they could both help each other excel in education and sports.
22266	8	1	It made Paul feel like he wasn't alone or by himself after all. In paragraph 45, Paul describes how it effects him, he says, 'Mr.Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' He felt bonded with Mr.Leonard.
22267	8	2	This new information changes his whole view of Mr. Leonard. He now realizes that Mr. Leonard is like him, Paul, in that he has trouble with being able to read as well.
22268	8	1	The background information has inspired Paul to learn how to read and do his best in school.
22269	8	2	When Paul gets backround information on Mr. Leonard he is empathetic, because he can't read either. Paul also said,' I knew them well----feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. ' This statement shows how he is empathetic. After this though he becomes strived to achieve in training for hurtles.
22270	8	0	The effect that the background information gave on Paul is that he should try to do the things that you think that you cant do. IF you have the right help and support you can do anything. He shouldnt give up just because he can't do things other kids can. You can do anything if you just try.
22271	8	0	The backround information that Paul gets about Mr.Leonard is about how he was a runner for his collage, and he flunked out. He also lost his scholarship and he couldnt read and they didnt want a runner that couldnt read however the collage scouts told him his grades didnt matter. He just wanted paul to understand thats school is very inportant.
22272	8	2	The effect of the background information on Paul was supriseing because he didn't know that Mr.Leonard was a allstar athlete and even in school he had reading problems. Mr.Leonard wanted to show Paul that he could over come his problems of not being able to read.
22273	8	2	He goes to the website the track coach gives him. To Paul's disbelief, he finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a track star. Paul couldn't believe what he had found out. He was astonished to see that Mr. Leonard had won national races and broke records. He confronted Mr. Leonard about all of it. He found out that Mr. Leonard also had issues reading and flunked out of college because of it.
22274	8	2	The information really changes the view of Mr. Leonard in that at first from the aritcle he read he felt more admiring of him. Later when Mr Leonard tells him that he can't read he is smpathetic and more close to him because Mr. Leonard is like him.
22275	8	1	the training that helped Paul couldn't read either so when Paul figured this infomation out he knew how his trainer felt.
22276	8	1	The background information about Mr. Leonard gave Paul so inspiration, because since he had found out that Mr. Leonard hadn't been so good in school, paul was going to help him since Mr. Leonard was teaching him track.
22277	8	0	Paul sees that he is being coached by a great athlete who had many successes. That had to have made paul feel that he was going to get better because his coach  had experience.
22278	8	2	Mr. Leonard embodies the once great, old mentor cliche. Because Paul is unaware of Mr. Leonard's past, and is used to following his orders, Paul is willing to try the things Mr. Leonard confronts him with. As stated in paragraph one, the last sentence, 'everyone complied.' No one questioned Mr. Leonard, and therefore his past was never questioned.     When Mr. Leonard becomes empathetic towards Paul, it changes things. When you become used to someone, it becomes easier to question and learn about them. Paragraph eight foreshadows this relationship when it says the Mr. Leonard's 'gaze softened' towards Paul.     Not knowing about Mr. Leonard really has as much effect in the early stages of their acquaintance as much as later learning changes their relationship. When the coach writes out a web address and tells Paul, 'Visit this site. Do a search for 'Grabowski,'' it precludes the notion that Mr. Leonard's life was dull and without bother for question. Rather, it changes the accepted lack of knowledge to a pursuit of mystery.     Finally, when Paul learns of the reading impairment that he shares with the old janitor, the relationship is solidified because they have a common ground. Once the existance of this common ground is justified, that is, once Paul realizes that there is a common place between them, Leonard Grabowski becomes a much less abstract and more relateable figure.     For that reason the discovery of Mr. Leonard's past effects Paul, and the background information that was previously missing completes the puzzle and lays the groundwork for a more realistic and compelling relationship between mentor and student.
22279	8	2	Once Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has the same reading problem as him, Paul wants to help him just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul. Paul knows where Mr. Leonard is coming from by the 'emotion in Mr. Leonards vocie', 'the feelings of embarrassment', and not being excepted because 'no schools wanted a track runner who couldnt read.' So, Paul understanding Mr. Leonards situations, wants to help him train to be a good reader Just like Paul was trained to be a good track runner.
22280	8	0	Mr. leanord was a track runner, who was bad at school.it says so in the story.
22281	8	2	The new information motivates Paul to do well, and even to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
22282	8	1	Paul is shocked that Mr. leonard was a highschool tack star. Paul wants to train with him even more now.
22283	8	2	After knowing the background about Mr. Leonard, Paul seemed to admire him. When Paul first found out about all the records Mr. Leonard had broke he was amazed and shocked at the same time. Paul also felt sad for Mr. Leonard since he could not read. Paul wanted a way to help Mr. Leaonard, since he had helped him. So, he told him it was time for him to learn!
22284	8	0	The effect this has on paul is a postive effect. He sees that Mr. Leonard was very successful in something and he helped him become successful in it as well, without telling him about his achievments. Paul asks Mr. Lenord why he never shared this information with him, this being a touchy subject. When Paul sees that Mr. Leonard actually lost his scholarship due to grades it showed the importance of a good education.
22285	8	2	The background information helps Paul understand that Mr.Leonard was in the same situation that he is in high school. Mr.Leonard couldnt read but he was good as an athlete just as Paul is. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard learn to read.
22286	8	0	Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he thought that you had to be smart to there. He was also curious because if he couldn't get through high school on his own how did he expect to make it through college.
22287	8	0	The background of Mr.Leonard is very similiar to paul's, when you find out that Mr.Leonard can not read just like Paul, but Mr.Leonard did not have the resources that paul does. In the end after Mr.Leonard helps Paul succeed at track, Paul uses his resources to help Mr.Leonard.
22288	8	0	HE LEARNED THE COACH COULDNT READ ANS HE WAS GOOD AT TRACK.
22289	8	1	I think the backgorund information has a big impact on Paul. One reason I think this is because since Paul found out more about Mr. Leonard it really encouraged him to go for what he wanted and not let anything stand in his way. Even if Paul would ever fail on something he would have Mr. Leonard right there telling him to get right back up and try again.
22290	8	1	Paul realizes why Mr. leonard has been helping him, and helps him to understand better what his reasons were.
22291	8	0	Being known as the hall monitor, without a secondary or primary source. For Paul, there would have been no possible way for him to have known Mr. Leonard as a hurdler. It's easier to see him as an everyday, average person as he seems than a famous record breaking champion in his youth with the average job he has.
22292	8	0	its encouraging to know about his tutor.
22293	8	0	The information makes Paul curious as to why Mr. Leonard hadn't told him that information. The next day Pual asked Mr. Leonard about the paper he had printed off. Mr. Leonard tells him about it.
22294	8	0	That he gets into trouble and that he gets talked to about it.
22295	8	1	Learning that Mr. Leonard broke hurdling records in college made Paul curious about him. Paul confronts Mr. Leonard about it because he wants the teacher to explain it. This realization also helps Paul understand that Mr. Leonard has been coaching him because he wants Paul to succeed where he didn't.
22296	8	2	The informatin Paul recived aabout Mr. Leeonard makes Paul feel better. Pauls dont feel alone for not being able to read good because Mr. Leonard didn't do good in school either.
22297	8	0	it explains his life as a teacher.
22298	8	1	Paul knows almost exactly what Mr. Leonard is going through. They couldn't read but in Pauls' case, he has a class he goes to twice a week that helps him learn to read better.      Mr. Leonard didn't want Paul to end up like him but he felt that he had a connection with Paul. This whole time that Mr. Leonard had been telling him 'On your way' he had been training his mind and body to react to what Mr. Leonard says. When Leonard took him out to the track and said 'On your way' he was ready to listen. He automatically responded to it by saying 'yes sir'.      When Paul had found out what Leonard was all about from when he went to the coach, he was astonished. He confronted Mr. Leonard and asked him why he didn't tell him. Mr. Leonard explained the whole situation to him.      From that point on he understood what he had to do. He got as much help as possible and in the mean time got help for Mr. Leonard.
22299	8	2	Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard failed out of college and lost his athletic scholarship because he couldn't read.  This causes Paul to sympathize with Mr. Leonard, because he knows how the man feels.  They are both embarassed because of their inability to read, so they both help each other.  Mr. Leonard helps Paul improve his athleticism through track, and Paul begins to teach Mr. Leonard to read.  Paul also realizes that he is not alone, and that when another person helps you, you can also benefit them.
22300	8	2	Mr. Leonard's background imformation effects Paul because when Mr. Leonard was young he flunked out of college because he said no one wanted atrack runner who could not read. Mr. Leonard is alo embarassed to admit he had flunked out of college. This has an effect on Paul because Paul is not so good at reading and is embarrased to go to a learning center for tutoring. This is why Mr. Leonard's background effected Paul and Paul's motivation.
22301	8	2	When Paul finds out that the man who was coaching him at hurdling was a college star who broke national records, he feels a little confused and more honored to be taught by someone like this. Supporting details that Paul was confused could be when he brought up the page he printed off from the website where he discovered Mr. Leonard's past. Mr. Leonard didn't seem too enthused by it, but Paul continued to pry and find out what happened. Once he knew, Paul then felt empathetic toward Mr. Leonard, since they shared the same problem.
22302	8	2	The effect of the background information that Paul found on Mr. Leonard was that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, because of this, Paul realizes how important it is to learn and not give up in school. I feel that being in track will make Paul a better student and he will recognize how important learning is to make it through college.
22303	8	0	After all of his training with Mr. Leonard, POaul gets fairly good at jumping hurdles. So good that he gets asked to practice with the highschool track team. After telling the coach about who he had been training with, the coach gave Paul a URL to the schools track website.      Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a track runner when he was in school, a very good one,. he won prizes and broke records. Paul was confused as to why Mr. Leonard hadn't mentioned this to him before, so the asked him. Mr. Leonard shared that he had been an excellent athlete, but not a good enough student, he wasn't given the opportunities or resources in school to improve, so even though he was so good he was offered a scholarship, he couldn't do the work and flunked out of college. He was obviosly embarrased, and didn't want to discourage Paul, because Paul had natural talent.
22304	8	2	The background information that Paul recieves just sort of gives him an inspiration to continue trying his best. He learns from Mr. Leonard the importance of studying and making good grades. For example, Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his poor grades. This point proves that without good grades Paul will basically go no where and end up being a hall monitor.
22305	8	0	The narrator informs the reader that the coach was a college athlete that won the 400 meter hurdles in nationals, witch means the coach has plenty of experence of running the track. That information helped the narrator relizes that he is learning from one of the best, and that he knows if he sticks to running he can do alot even if his grades are bellow average or that hes not a good reader.
22306	8	1	The effect of the background info on Paul is that he realizes he is not alone.
22307	8	0	The effect that the background information has on paul is. Paul wants to be like Mr.Leonard so he tries todo what he does. most of the time paul just dont want to upset the coach so he does what he says anyways.paul may also want to be encouraged by Mr.Leonard to do the right thing and be the perosn that he wants to be in life.so in my eyes that's the effect that Mr.Leonard background information has on paul.
22308	8	2	Paul is deeply moved because he can relate with Mr. Leonard about not being able to read. Paul wants to help him learn how to read since he is being taught at the learning center himself. Mr. Leonard never had the opportunity to learn when he was younger. He is also surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about his track successes in college. Paul sees that he is a modest person who doesn't flaunt his gifts and talents.
22309	8	2	The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul found out effects Paul because both have reading problems. Mr. Leanoard states 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.'

22310	8	2	He feels empahy for Mr. Leonard. He knows how it feels to not do well when it comes to school. Paul feels embbarrassed when he has o ead aloud or doesn't know an answer everyone else knows.

Paul is a little disappointed the next day that he did not get the information directly from Mr. Leonard.

22313	8	1	Paul is confused as to why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his background information. Then he realized that just because someone cannot read does not mean that they cannot do anything else in life.
22314	8	1	After getting the informaton about Mr. Leonard, Paul reliezes that even though he cant read he shouldn't not that hold him back.
22315	8	1	I think it gave Paul confidence because Mr.Leonard was not a good student like him, but whent on to do amazing things in colage and setting many records, I also motiveted Paul to keep up his studies and use trake and a outlit from stress and school and to be able to fit in more.

When Mr.Leoard told Paul he couldnt read and he flunked out of college because he couldnt read it made Paul want to work hard. Paul helped Mr.Leonard read.
22321	8	0	The background helps us understand the story more.
22322	8	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul is effected by is that Mr. Leonard isn't the best reader ever and Paul was going to the Learning Center for reading help. Paul thought Mr. Leonard had gone to college. Paul had then found out that Mr. Leonard was a track runner and not a very good student in school. That had effected Paul.
22323	8	2	The information that paul gets on Mr. Leonard is a big part of the effect that he has on Paul. Paul realizes that they relate to eachother alot and that it makes sense why Mr. Leonard is being so helpful to him. They share the same emotions , as Paul says the feelings of embarassment when approached with not being able to read, they are one in the same.
22324	8	2	The effect of the background information has on Paul is that is shows him that Mr. Leonard was just like him. He finds out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. Mr. Leonard says in the story that he couldn't read, but back then there were no remdial reading programs. He also flunked out of college because of it, but the information shows Paul that Mr. Leonard is just trying to give this kid the help he couldn't get when he was in that situation.

22329	8	0	The effect that the background information has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard told him the college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter, that he would have tutors to help him, but also that he thought college is a whole lot harder than high school. He went on to say that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of high school. He mentioned that no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. The effect was that Paul felt bad for him but he felt the same way, so there wasn't much of an effect. If there was any effect, it was emotionally.
22330	8	2	When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard broke records in college but then didn't finish college, made him confused. When Mr. Leanard told Paul that the reason he couldn't finish college because he didn't take school seriously, Paul was surprised and knew that if he followed his dreams and worked hard at school and life, he could accomplish anything. Since Paul had the privilege to work hard in school and do a sport that he worked hard to be good at, he would do anything to succeed. Mr. Leonard believed that Paul had potential.
22331	8	1	The background information about Mr. Leonard seems to help Paul to try harder to strive for excellence.  He is first a little suspicious when he is stopped and asked where he is going and why he is going to the Learning center.  He soon starts to be coached by Mr. Leondard and forms a better relationship with him.  Paul grew really suspicious when Mr. Leonard asked Paul his name even though he checked Paul's hall pass twice a week.  Then the track coach told him to do a search for Grabowski on the internet.  He finally realized who Mr. Leonardd really was.
22332	8	0	Paul finds out that  Mr. Leonard also had a reading dissability in school.  The first clue that hints this is when Mr. Leonard asks Paul what his name is.  Paul then wonders why he would ask that when he had seen his hall pass for days straight.  Once paul finds out about the dissability that Mr. Leonard has, he then becomes encouraging and tells him that they need to start training Mr. Leonard for track.  This whole situation has a very positive affect on Paul.
22333	8	2	Paul is shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading also, but that did not stop him from succeeding in a sport. Paul relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him and feels that he should help Mr. Leonard read now.

He had broken many records and was very fast at running.  After Paul asks Mr. Leonard why he had not choosen to tell Paul about his famous ascubuidy, he discovers that Mr. Leonard had flunked out and that he could not read.  Paul instead of feeling disapiontment, one may feel that he gained respect for Mr. Leonard.  I believe this to be true because in this article Paul says this, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard.  Its time to start your training.'
22335	8	0	Paul was a track star in high school and collehe but he had a problem. He did not amke good grade so there for he was kicked off the team and also out of college. There for his track days were over.

He knew that if he pushed and worked hard at learning to read and with track, he could go to college as well.
22337	8	0	Mr. Leonard did not learn how to read well when in high school, so when he found Paul going to the learning center he felt the empathy to help him and train him, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's voice were all too familiar to me. I knew them well- feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
22338	8	1	It impresses him to see how good Mr. Leonard used to be. This also confueses him, becuase he doesn't understand why he didn't tell him about his college successes.
22339	8	1	Towards the ends of the story Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a very good track star and that he even broke records. When Mr. Leonard later revealed his story about how he always got by in life, this sparked a light in Paul's head.

At the end of the passage Paul makes Mr. Leonard follow him as he takes him on a journey to reading.

It also makes Paul feel less alone, to know that he isn't the only person to have reading problems. Mr. Leonard's story encourages Paul to do the best he can in school, and to not give up on his dreams.
22345	8	0	'Things were different back then''.The college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter.
22346	8	0	I think there is no effect on Paul because he was just doing a background check on someone.
22347	8	2	The backgorund information is really important in this story, or it would really have never ended. The backgorund information came from the track coach, just curious to see if Paul would actually check it out. He did, and found out that the guy that was helping him was a real athlete, but once Paul talked to him, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he did. He couldn't read.

He then states the general idea of the whole paragraph which is that many people are concerned about 'space junk.' He then goes on  to explain exactly what 'space junk' is in the next section. In the following section he explains how many pieces of small debris are created when satellites crash into each other or when astronauts accidentally lose a tool bag. He then goes on to tell about what harmful effects 'space junk' can have. He then concludes the article by stating his first idea again and stating that many organizations are trying to do something about the problem.
24817	9	2	The author organizes this peice into different sections to help the reader better understand the importance of space debris. For example the author separates the passage into four different sections with titles at the begining to help the reader better understand it.

24824	9	2	He organizes the article by subject. For example, 'Crash Course' describes the collision of an American and Russian satellite and a toolbag lost in space. and, 'What is Space Junk' describes how debris from satellites in space is created.
24825	9	1	Throughout the article you come across many titiles. This is a way to break each topic down to become more specfic. With each title the author has a cathy pharse to go with it, so at frist glance you think that the topic in minor or unimportant, but you are wrong. the author organized it from his to recents occurences so show that it has been a problem for some tinme now.
24826	9	0	The 'junk' in space is very harmful to earths surface because if a metorite comes and crashes into earth that is becuse of all the trash in space.

It's a . . . tool bag?'  In the next section, 'What Is Space Junk?' the author tells the audience about how space exploration started and the various objects that have been realeased into our solar system that are considered space junk.  In the next section, 'Crash Course' the author describes how old satelittes that are no longer being controlled can crash into each other and create microdebris.  In the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', the author explains how this microdebris travels ar high speeds and can still do damage to space ships and astronauts even though the microdebris is very little. Using this method the author is able to explain the harms of space junk to the audience in the simplest method.

25047	9	2	The author organizes the article in four different ways. First, the author starts with extremely exclamitory statements to get you intersted in the first paragraph. Second, the author gives you a history on the great space invasion, then the importance of space junk. Third, the author explains crash courses and the magnitude of crashes in space. Lastely, he concludes what he has explained in the first three ways of discription and wraps up the article.
25048	9	0	On my own opinion I think the author organizes the article well by starting with rhetorical questions and this  gains attention to the reader and also the way he arranges his paragraphs by describing how the great space invasion and continues his article by giving the causes, reasons, how,effects and conclusion this makes the article organization good and proffesional.
25049	9	1	The author organizes the article from the introduction, which is very enthusiastic, to pull in his reader. Then he gives you a brief history on the matter he is talking about. Then to the matter itsself. Finally to how important this matter is to him and our earth.
25050	9	1	He titles each paragraph, the explains in good details on why the junk in space is dangerous. It also catches the readers eye and makes them want to read more and more of it.
25051	9	0	they explore the vast reaches of our solar system, monitor atmospheric conditions, and make global wireles communication possible.
25052	9	1	in the passage the author uses titles, to organize the article. The use of titles alows for different materials to be seperated from each other, and to group the alike material.
25053	9	2	The author organizes the article with multiple sections. Each section describes the problem of space junk a little more to the reader. The section titles 'What IS Space Junk?' explains that space junk is the debris in spacve that are orbitting Earth, such as broken space capsules, telescopes and satellites. The section called 'Crash Course' explains that sometimes these objects crash into eachother. Because these objects can be traveling at speeds of more than 20,000 miles per hour they break into hundreds of pieces that each assume their own orbitual path. The last section called 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' describes how big of a problem space junk is. Because these debris are traveling so quickly they can damage the most carefully designed spacecraft. It also tells the reader that the amount of space junk is increasing creating more of a problem.
25054	9	2	The author organizes this article very well. He starts off by getting the reader's attention with rhetorical questions. Then he continues by explaining what space junk is exactly. After that he tells the reader what can happen when satellites are sent up to space. Finally, the author finishes by telling the reader how much of an impact this actually has.
25055	9	2	Th author organizes this article into sections. Each section further explains the issue or gives background information. The author gives information on satellities and objects that can get lost in space and the effect it has on space travel.
25056	9	0	The author organizes the article by telling you what space junk was and the way it occurs.
25057	9	0	The author does a very good job by organizing his article. He starts off in the introduction as a light tone, but than gets more serious. This draws the reader in, and keeps the reader occupies. The way the author orders the article occupies the readers mind.
25058	9	1	The author organizes the article by explaining what space junk is, what happens to the junk, and last how much damage they can do.
25059	9	1	The article first explains what space junk is, then how it gets there, next how dangous it can be, and how it can get worse.
25060	9	1	they explain the importance of space dabris an how it can effect the satellites orbiting the earth. the littlest fragment can cause a big problem.
25061	9	2	First the author introduces what space junk is. Then next the author tells about two satellites crashing in the section crash course. Then the author ends with the section, Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
25062	9	1	The author first organizes the article with the introduction. Then into the second paragraph describing the details in the introduction paragraph. The third gives facts and intresting details to inform people about the severity of space debris.
25063	9	1	The author organizes the information in a way in which the reader can understand the complex topic. First by giving information about the first satellites and objects were sent into space. Second by giving details about how space junk comes to be.
25064	9	2	The author organizes the article by different categories, such as: What Is Space Junk? and Crash Course. This makes it easier for the reader to read and identify what they are going to read.
25065	9	0	Well first he gets you in to it by the first paragraph than his tone changes . It is organized preety well. They got the paragraph space junk thats a interesting paragraph the aithor trys to bring you in this story.
25066	9	1	The author organizes this article by starting with an attention grabber that makes you think because, at first it makes no since. He then goes on to explain it starting with a story about how the problem started to ending with why it is important to fix it.
25067	9	1	The author organizes the article in a different way. The author puts the article in three different sections or chapters.
25068	9	2	He has titles and then talks about what the title was. They also built off each other. Such as he talks about space junk then some of the ways some of it has gotten to space and what it does up  there.
25069	9	2	The author organizes the article in a way to help explain the problem of space junk thouroughly and make it easier to understand. The author starts by grabbing your attention saying to look at the sky and see a tool bag (paragraphs 1 and 2). The author then starts to explain the history of space junk and how 'the human race's great space invasion' started it all (paragraph 4). Next, the different things that become space junk are explained by stating how 'the disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit (paragraph 5). The author also shows the dangers of space junk by saying that 'bits of space debris present a very serious problem' because 'tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the the most carefully designed spacecraft' (paragraph 9). Finally, the author tells how agencies are looking for 'an easy solution to the problem of space junk'. This ends the article by emphasizing the importance of this problem.
25070	9	1	The author organizes the article by different sections.  He has a topic then talks about the topic and does not get off subject.
25071	9	0	It list thing in how they think it should be.
25072	9	0	He makes he to weree he can under stand how and what junk is and how bad it is.
25073	9	0	by creating several articles supporting the main idea.
25074	9	2	The author organizes the article into four sections. The first section, 'Orbiting Junk,' acts as an introduction that hooks the readers interest, making them want to read more about space debris and how it occurs. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?' goes into detail about what 'space junk' is and how all that waste come to settle into our orbit in the first place. The next section, 'Crash Course,' explains the dangers of dead satellites in the atmosphere and how they are at risk for collisions.The last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' relates back all the information about 'space junk' back to the reader, explaining it's signifigance and why the reader should care.
25075	9	2	The author starts out with an exciting yet almost comical opener. It wasn't something i expected, but obviously something i needed to know, since it is currently a concern to government space agencies.     The second paragraph begins by giving us some background on what exactly this space junk is. It tells us that there are objects positioned hundreds of miles above Earth and some of them circle the planet indefinitely. Now, once this piece of high-teck space object 'dies' it become one more piece of junk added to space, which makes a problem because now its circling the globe in an uncontrolled manner.     Then it leads us into the crash course section explaining the now dead satellites have the risk of crashing into one another. The effect of that happening now causes the problem of tiny little pieces of debris floating around all throughout space. But those pieces are not the only debris that roams the atmosphere, any object that are released into space become free-orbiting satellites. So are astronauts have to be very cautions while in space to be sure nothing is left out in the open.     The last topic the author touches on is how little things propose a bigger problem. Those little pieces are flying around at five miles per second! That is pretty dangerous because when we send our spacemen up there, if one of those were to hit the shuttle, it could easily go strait through it, or damage it to a certain degree that would only make their journey more difficult. Never fear though, scientist have worked hard on a solution as to how they will keep track of all the debris, and they ended up just giving them different code names, and keeping a radar on them at all times, that way they know the safety zones for whats good, and whats bad.
25076	9	1	It's basically like a debate, and this was his side of things. He got the information used to show that it is a problem, out there or Earth too, like it said, if it got into our atmosphere, it could seriously do some damage, falling materials all over could wipe out millions of people.      It's also not healthy for the enviroment of Earth and Space either. The earth could have some more junk all over, and if there is junk in pace then it could come really polluted up there, who knows how much of our things is hurting everyone.
25077	9	2	He starts with a grabber then he explains what space junk is. Then he talk about what happened in 2009, Then finally starts talking about the little bits of trash in space.
25078	9	0	The author organizes the article by using certain parts of history.
25079	9	2	The author organizes this article by starting out by stating the problem and then moving on to the specific sections that describe different issues, such as, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' (Orbiting Junk).

25081	9	2	The author first starts out with an introduction which informs us of what the article is about. The author then goes in to a sublevel which tells us of what space junk is. The author says that it is stuff that is lost in space and becomes a free roaming satellite. The author then goes into a different sublevel called crash course. This warns us of what could happen when the space junk gets released. The last sublevel is called little bits, but a big deal. This sublevel tells us that space junk is quite small but it is very dangerous because it flies at a rate of 5 miles per second.
25082	9	0	by telling what it is and then explaning how it works
25083	9	0	The author organized the article to give you supporting details an events showing the reader what ends up in space after so long, then when it comes time to get around it, the items are to small to detect on radar so they dont know everything that is floating around out there?
25084	9	2	The author organizes the article in a understandable way. He has the title 'Orbiting Junk' which tells the reader that overall idea. Then he has subtitles for when hes changing the matter of deatials on space junk. For example his first subtitle is 'What Is Space Junk?' In that passage he explains throughly to the reader what space junk is. He also stays on topic. For each section he writes about he dosen't get off topic he stays specific about what he writes about.
25085	9	0	It is just talking about junk and how it can be used.
25086	9	1	The author organizes the article by having different headlines talking about the stuff that has happen or can happen in space.
25087	9	2	First the author has an interesting introduction that really grabs a readers attention. Next, the author describes what exactly is being talked about. Then the problems that the space junk form is talked about and previous incidents that have happened. The last paragraph shows the reasons why it is important and how it is dangerous.
25088	9	1	Organizing an article in a way that the reader becomes interested is not always an easy task.  This author, however, did a great job.  In stead of starting off with bring facts about space, the author decided to use a sense of humor that gets the reader's attention.  After this, the author organized the article in a way that maximizes the education of 'space junk' before the article goes into the harms of it while in space.
25089	9	1	The author of this article organizes this article by using different topics throughout the peice. He uses headings when he changes thought as well. These headings help to let the reader understand that he is changing topic and that he is keeping numerous paragraphs under the same topic.

25092	9	2	The author organizes the article by placing information under a title of a section that applies to what is in the section. For example, in the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?', he tells you what space junk is and how it is formed or created.
25093	9	1	The author organizes the article by splitting up the topics he wants to cover, if he adds a a title to the topic he wants to cover more people will be more willing to read them or even keep reading than if the topic was just all bunched together, the author seperates his topics and explains what each topic is to help the reader understand the problem more easily.
25094	9	1	The author organizes the article by informative sections. Each section has a specific topic the author explains to the reader. He/She breaks it down so the passage is more comprehensible.
25095	9	1	First, the author graps your attention.  Then, explains space junk and reveals its a big deal.
25096	9	2	The author organizes the article with first an attention grabber.  Such as, 'Grab you telescope'! 'Look up in the sky'! 'It's a comet'! 'It's a meteor'! Then the author gets a more serious tone because he is trying to make a point and let you know how dangerous 'space junk' is. After this, the author lets you know what space junk is. And what a crash course is. Then he says that little bits can be a big deal and explains why. And last, he ends it with all of it is a serious problem.
25097	9	1	The author organize this article by first telling us what he is talking about then he explans to the reader what he is excatly talking about. The author then gose on to tell the reader what the effects of space junk are doing to space. The author puts the article in cronagale oder for the most part.
25098	9	1	The author supports this article by seperating the different topics with subtitals. He seperates all the information into the following sections, 'What is Space Junk,' 'Crash Course,' 'Little Bits,' and 'But a Big Deal.'

After the introduction, the author uses a historical timeline of the space race to give the reader information about how we got there. Then the author discusses how satellites can become space junk. The author concludes by discussing how the little bits of space trash can be harmful to our space research.
25103	9	0	The author organizes the article by explaining at first about the past and when they first had found junk in space. Then he explained  about how everything went wroong because of something so little.
25104	9	2	First he grabs your attention with a exclammatory statement, then proceeds to explain the main idea of the passage and tells you a little about satellites. After he explains the main idea, he goes a little more in depth, and tells you what the problem is with having dead satellites in space. Lastly, he explains that even the smallest space debris can pose a very serious hazard to a person.
25105	9	2	The author organizes this article by putting different titles and sections when he is discussing a new topic. Like he put 'What is Space Junk?' to tell us more about what this term is and then he made a new paragraph 'Crash Course' so that he could explain what this 'space junk' is doing to us, and what is happening around us. I think that it was good he put it into different sections becasue it makes it less confusing and it helps us understand  the different parts of the story better.
25106	9	0	He organizes is very well and clearly spoken. With questioning what peoples opihnion's are while learning more about the situation.
25107	9	0	The auther organizes this article by importance. It would be important to know what space junk is before you read the other paragraphs to know what happens to space junk.
25108	9	1	The author first defines what 'space junk' really is for those that are unaware of what it is and how it gets where it is. Following 'What is Space Junk?' is 'Crash Course'. This section of the article gives an example of when a dead Russian satelite and a dead American satelite crashed into eachother. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section and gives the effects that some of these small pieces of debris can harm spacecrafts and even astronauts.
25109	9	2	The author organize the article in order. First he made the introduction appealing by writing 'It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a tool bag?' to get the readers attention of what space junk is. After he explain what space junk is, by telling how all started. Then he explain how the satellites collide with each other. And finally he explain the problems space junk causes to space craft and how are countries trying to fix the problem.
25110	9	2	The author started the article with an attention grabber to spark some interest for the readers. They then wrote about the last few decades of space exploration to help the reader understand how often and how much we as a species clutter outer space. Finaly the author talks about how much damge this 'space junk' can cause to better our understanding of what the consequences are of satalite crashes or other accidents in space.
25111	9	1	she eplains it in different paragraphs and breaks it down to understand better of what it is and how it was created.
25112	9	1	The author made the introduction a Attention getter. Than he/she made titles which was followed up behind by Details.
25113	9	0	The author organizes the article by building up the information about space junk and how it will effect futre spece exploration.
25114	9	2	The author organizes the article by beginning with a few questions that may seem humorous in order to set a tone of interest in the reader as they begin reading the article. The author then proceeds to change the tone for he rest of the article to assume a more serious demeanor since he wants to create emphasis on the danger of the topic.     The author, after the introduction, begins by defining what space junk is and how it occurs- providing strictly fact or background information on space junk in order to provide an idea about what the article is basically about and to give the reader a rudementary understanding of the subject before the reader is subject to more information or opinions on the subject.     The author can then go more deeply into the effects of space junk and who is monitoring it and how it can be harmful to future space exploration.
25115	9	2	The author organizes the article by using subheadings to talk about different subjects in the same topic. For example one of the subheadings is called 'What Is space junk?' in that section he talks about the type of objects circling around space. In the subheading 'Crash Course he talks about satellites crashing. They talk about the same topic which is relating to space junk but different subjects like how satellites crash.
25116	9	0	first he explains what ...
25117	9	0	He starts it off with exciting statements so he can get the readers attention and then he starts goin into good detail about how the space junk can be a serious problem.
25118	9	0	Well he tells that space is full of stuff and what thr reader to know the improtantice of it all.
25119	9	2	The author organizes the article into groups of paragraphs using bolded words, such as 'What Is Space Junk?', or 'Crash Course.'
25120	9	1	The author organizes the article very neatly. The author has the article divided into sections, each of which has it's own purpose.
25121	9	2	The article starts out with a catchy introductionby telling readers to 'Grab your telescope!' The second paragraph goes right into defining what 'space junk' is and how it is harmful. It then talks about how satellite crashed can create debris. The article goes on to talk about the fact that the debris created cannot be detected if it is smaller than a baseball. This means that it is hard for spacecrafts to steer clear of the debris. The author discribes this as grains of sand being shots from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.
25122	9	1	The author organized this article by talking about space junk and how harmful it is to talking about crashes and how little things can be a big deal.
25123	9	2	He starts out by explaining a small portion of the problem. The author then goes in to describe what space junk is defined as so there is a better understanding of the problem. The author goes on to state that all satellites will eventually crash into some kind of object at some point and how big of an issue it really is. Then the author describes that even though the pieces may be really small there is still a large possibility that it can damage the satellite and spacecraft.
25124	9	1	The author breaks it down into smaller peices. He has a whole paper but breaks it down into small secounds with sub titles. With in those sub titles he explains more on that situation.
25125	9	1	First the author uses a 'hook' to get you interested. Ten they give some background information on the topic including the year 1957 when the Russians first entered space. They then describe how mor debri is made and why it is a big deal, these paragraphs are the main body. They concludes by telling what space agencies are doing to find an answere to the problem.
25126	9	2	The author organizes this article by explaining what is in space, then going further in deatil and explaining history of space pollution and how it gets there, then finally explains how just small pieces can cause damage forever. The author went through that order to make it more understandable and to emphasize the problem to the reader.
25127	9	2	The author organizes the article by topics. The autor will start a new section by adding a title to inform the reader what it will be about. The article on Crash Course is simply explaining the number of collisions made every year in space.
25128	9	1	The author uses the last sentence from one paragraph to lead into the next paragraph. In the last sentence of the first paragraph the author writes 'This space junk is currently of great concern...', then the title of the next paragraph is What is Space Junk? The author organizes the paragraphs in such a way as to lead us onto the next topic of discussion.
25129	9	1	The author organize the article by tellin what is space junk and how why its thier and what happens to th satilltes once it has crashed into another and then he axplain what it looks like in space once it has turn into microscopic peices and is orbiting around the solour system.
25130	9	1	He has different sections for each big thing he is talking about. He makes it easier for people to read and understand why the outer space is so important.
25131	9	2	The author organizes the article by making titles for each section.  For example, when the author talks about how space junk can crash into other objects in space, the title for that section is 'Crash Course.'  The author also starts off explaining what space junk is, then moves on to tell the reader how it is dangerous, and explains how big of deal it really is at teh end of the article.
25132	9	0	The author organize it by the tillin them what to do once they grab the telescope.
25133	9	2	The article starts with an introduction, then explains what space junk is, how it happens, and why it is important to know about.
25134	9	1	The author first grabs your attention in a light hearted way by doing a little conversation. Then he really informs you on the origin of how space junk came to be with 1957 Soviet Union launced the first artificial satellite. Which was soon followed by te first USA satellite. Then he explains how the space junk is affecting current space explorations and projects by the debris destroying high tech, very expensive machines in space. This was a very easy to understand way to read how over time a tiny piece of debre can become a monumental problem.
25135	9	0	He organizes it like its a cause and effect essay.
25136	9	1	The author organizes this article by first grabbing our attenion with the use of a seemingly absurd statement, the nexplaining wh ythe statement is not absurd. He then tells us the origin of space junk, some incidents caused by it, and the lingering porblem of space junk in chronological order.
25137	9	2	Throughout the article, the author organizes each section by the general time of the action. After the beginning, when the autor captivates the attention of the reader, the author begins to tell the reader about the first launching of space satellites, and the particular elements of space science. The author then begins to write about the relevance of space debris to now, followed by any solutions that have been brought up in the past years.
25138	9	2	The author divides the article in to 4 sections. First is draw the attention of the reader us. The second section is to identify what Space junk is and what the article is about. The next section is about how satilites crash and what happens after the problem occurs. Last he exsplains why the problem is a serous matter and what scientists are doing to fix the problem.
25139	9	2	The author organizes the article by going in order of importance, or relevant information. The author first explains what space junk is by giving the reader a brief overview of the definition and history of spacejunk. Next, the author discusses how space junk can come about, explaining that dead satellites may ultimately mulitply into a mass amount of space junk if said satellite crashes into another dead satellite. Finally, the author stresses the importance of the dangers of space junk, stating that any microdebris smaller than the size of a baseball can go undetected. This undected microdebris may pose as a serious threat to space travelers because the microdebris may cause harm to the spacecraft.
25140	9	2	The author starts by making a simple statement. Than he explains what 'Space junk' is and how it cause our Earth many problems. In the third sections, the author explains crash course, which is uncontroled satellites that collide with each other causing pieces of debris to fly through space.In his final section, he explains that even though the problem is small its still a big deal. The paragraph explains a small fragment travling at the speed of five miles per second can cause serious damage.Which is followed by the auther saying that the problem is increasing.The whole article explains and show more information to us to better understand.
25141	9	1	The Author puts everything in sections so that it is easy to understand.
25142	9	1	The author organizes this article by telling what space junk is then how it effects and other things such as satellites. Also, the author gives examples to help compare what it is like for a small piece of debris in space smashing into a satellite. One example from the article to give us an idea of what it is like in space, like if a grain of sand were blowing in the wind vs a grain of sand chipping paint off of a wall.
25143	9	0	by explaining diferent problems and courses
25144	9	0	He organizes it with a narrative prompt and an essay to go with it.
25145	9	1	Right away the author grabs the reader's attention, but shortly after that she becomes serious. She starts off by explaining what 'space junk' is and what kind of 'junk' we have floating around in space. She provides the background information to help us understand the rest of the article. She next tells us the damages done in the 'Crash Course' section. In the end the author expresses to us how little particles can cause the most damge.
25146	9	0	He makes it exciting at first then settles down and gets serious about the satellites and how important they are, and how dangerous it is if they hit stuff.
25147	9	2	The author organizes his information by organizing it by the topic or incident it pertains too. For example, they sort all the information about the satellites' collision of 2009  into a paragraph titled 'Crash Course.' Also, they title the paragraph telling the reader exactly what this cosmic debris is in a paragraph title 'What is Space Junk?'
25148	9	0	they explore the vas reaches of the solar sistem monitor atmospheric conditions and make global wireless
25149	9	2	First the author grabs our attention with his first statements by acting as if he's telling you to look in the sky. Next He uses one paragraph to sum up just the topic of his article. After his one paragraph he decides to tell you more information by organized sections. The first section tells you what space junk is so you can know what he means when talking. After you have realized what space junk is he goes on to give a example on what can happen with space junk. When he trys to tell you of how small things at a fast pace can be dangerous he tell you about that in the next article. Basically the author uses two beginning statements, one paragraph, and 3 sections to explain and organize his concerns on space junk.
25150	9	1	The author uses an interesting introduction to catch the reader's attention. Then he breaks down all the omportant things about space junk. He emphasizes the importance of how dangerous space junk can be.
25151	9	1	The author organizes the article by using different topics at each paragraph and by explaining why each are different at each paragragh and how each differ and rise in each paragraph. It also talks about the problems that each face and how to overcome them.
25152	9	2	The author organizes this article in such a way that answers a question that a reader may have once they gain new information in the previous section or paragraph. For instance, in the introduction, we learn the term 'space junk.' The next section of the article is titled 'What is Space Junk?' The next title, 'Crash Course,' helps to show what has caused this issue of space junk. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' addresses any doubts that the reader may have about space junk being a true issue. This organization makes the article easy for the reader to read and comprehend.
25153	9	1	He organizes his article in sections. Each section is in order explaining the last. This allows a reader to not get lost.
25154	9	0	Each paragraph fits in with the next one.
25155	9	1	The author starts off by giving us a attention getter. Then telling us about the history of space travel.

25192	9	1	The organization is from past to present. He first tell you about the orbiting of space an what is out thier. Then he calls it junk because sometimes the stuff they lost or put in space becomes very dangerous to the planet but no one knows. The reason why because if you tell people the truth they wouldnt know how to handle it or how to act when you tell them. Some people over exzagerate the problem and cause all kinds of confusion. Space is a dangerous place to enter and play around with. There is no gravity or oxygen to provide, unless your on a spaceship. Most times space ships are not even safe. Some people can not handle moving slow or seeing things they have never seen before.   He was telling about the spaceship that was first launched in 1957 by the Soviet Union but it was artificial and the the United States followed suit. Whicha began the human race's great space invation. Thing like that causes confusion to everyone who can not ake it. He also was giving information about the variety of spacecrafts their was and about the global communicaton an how they launch spaceships. He kept it plan an simple and to the point how distrutive people are to their world and even to outerspace that is most dangerous to the earth.   In conclusion, the fact that the matter is. No matter how big, small, tiny or larger objects are it is so dangerous to people an the earth and it's surroundings. It could cause major damage to people and the earth if it falls straight out from the sky.

25257	9	2	The author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is, which he says are pieces of sattelites that get stuck in orbit. He explains how the junk comes to be and what happens to it. He also gives information on how space junk comes to be. It is caused when sattelites break or run into eachother.      Lastly, he describes the bad effects space junk have. He says all of the upcoming space exploration is increasing the amount of space junk which is cluttering the atomsphere. He says the new amounts is making space travel more difficult and everyone needs to work together to limit the amounts.
25258	9	2	The author of this article organized his work into sections. He began with in introduction to help introduce the problem and catch the readers attention. Then he explained the basic history of what we have in our orbital in the section called 'What Is Space Junk.'

25262	9	2	The author organized this story into different sections. The author first gets our attention with the introductions. The author then gives us some background information on the history of space junk and how it can effect the earth. Next, we find out how harmful this space junk really is. It talks about the collisions of satellites and how they are harmful to earth. Finally the author tells us that once they have collided they are formed into little bits that are still a big deal. It is hard for spacecrafts to steer clear of this tiny object.
25263	9	2	The author organizes the article in little sections to highlight each thing you need to know about Space Junk. Like the first section what is space junk, the author explains what Space Junk is and where it comes from. The Crash Course section talked about two satellites colliding into each other. The Little Bits, But a Big Deal section talks about the hazards of microdebris floating through space, and the increasing amount amount of Space Junk  caused by commercial space travel.
25264	9	0	I really dont understand the question you are aking me.
25265	9	0	They talk about the history of satelites.
25266	9	2	The author organizes the article in a very good way. The introduction is first. Next, we find out what 'Space Junk' actually is. Then, It talks about how it is made when satellites collide and crash which causes it to form into smaller pices because everything breaks apart at very fast speeds.
25267	9	1	The authour organize the article by folloowing from the beginning to where it talk about Space Junk. Secondly it goes from there to where it ends to crash of the course. Lastly it goes to Big Deals where it talkls about 'tiny fragments traveling at speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft'.
25268	9	0	The autor put it in A order where the reader will know where to look to find information
25269	9	1	Well he starts off as like in a excited tone but then goes into detail about how space junk jas came to be and made our solar system very very dangerous and how a lot of our satelites can be destroyed from these little pieces of debris moving at a high rate of speed.
25270	9	2	THE AUTHOR ORGANIZE THE ARTICLE BY BREAKING EACH OF THE THING HE WANT TO TLAK ABOUT INTO THREE LITTLE SECTION. LIKE THE FIRST ONE IS REALLY JUST TELLING YOU ABOUT THE JUNK THE BE IN SPACE AND THE SECOND IS TALKING ABOUT HOW YOU CAN CRASH WHY YOU IN SPACE IF YOU DONT HAVE ALL CONTROL OF YOUR SPACESHIP. AND THE LAST ONE JUST TALKS ABOUT LILTTLE THINGS THAT CAN FALL FROM SPCAE AND SOME PEOPLE DONT THINK THAT ITS A BIG DEAL BUT IT IS.

25273	9	1	The auther organizes this articale by starting this article with a shocking statement to make the reader want to read the article. After the auther has the readers attention, the auther uses facts to show the dangers of space junk and why it is a big deal.
25274	9	1	He explains what it is, what happens due to that space junk, and then some facts about what has happened.
25275	9	2	After the introduction, the author defines what they are talking about. The first section is 'What is Space Junk?' In this section, the author talks about what space junk is and how it is formed. The second second is called 'Crash Course' and it is about the dangers of the space junk. And then the author transitions into a related topic, tiny bits of space trash. The author talks about the dangers of even a small bit of space debris. The author concludes by talking about the current state of the problem of space junk and intiatives to try and solve the problem of space junk. Throughout the entire story, it is a progression. Setting the story up, defining terms and talking about how they are formed, what role they play, what damage they can do, and finally ways to stop the problem.
25276	9	2	The author starts with a catchy introduction that is an allusion to a common phrase from 'Superman.' He/she continues on with explaining in general what space junk is, and how some of it got into space. 'Crash Course,' the next section of the article, explains in more detail of two incidents in space that created space debris, a crash and a dropped tool box. Finally, the last few paragraphs explain why the little peices of space debris have such an impact due to the high speeds at which they travel. It also mentions why we should be concerened and how this problem, if not solved quickly, will become an even larger issue due to more and more space travel in the near future.
25277	9	2	The author organizes the article by introducing the concept of space junk in a fun way but quickly gets serious as the articles pass. He explains space junk by reviewing the space age, then getting to the matter at hand. He states that space junk is mostly created by satalite collisions in one article and also stating that microdebris from the space junk is very harmful to astronauts. The author explains the problem very well through a series of paragraphs.

25284	9	1	She puts subtitles to try to divid the importance of space.
25285	9	2	The author organizes this article into catagories and paragraphs. Each section in the story has its own signifcance to the background knowledge and effects of space junk. The section titled 'What is Space Junk?' refers to what it really is and how long its been in our orbit.
25286	9	0	He starts with what it is about then tells some of the history about it then tells what is going to happen if were not careful.
25287	9	0	farily decent
25288	9	2	The author begins with a catchy lead in, then he dives into the real issue: Space Junk. He then gives us a brief over view of Space Junk history, and NASA history. He then explains how 'dead' satellites are a major issue, and what they can do to one another. He also explains other forms of debris. Then he finally comes to his point, why its a big problem, and how we are trying to fix it.
25289	9	2	The author starts with a lucrative introduction and moves into the background information. Once the cause of the junk has been defined, the author tells the major causes of debris such as satellite crashes and accidents by astronauts. It then goes onto describe how and why we need to fix this very serious problem that we have caused by careless space exploration. The author then comes to a conclusion that the problem will ensue despite efforts to contain it.
25290	9	1	The author arganizes the article be having differernt titles in the one article.  The author does it by the importance of how it should be informed to others

25293	9	2	The author starts off by stating what he sees in the sky, is nothing but a simple tool bag. then he shoots right into detail about space junk. The author explains to us, that space junk is more of a problem than we might see it as. He goes on by telling us how dangerous it could be and how it could occur, then states that engineers are seeking and adding improvements to spacecrafts and spacesuits, so they can withstand this 'space junk.'
25294	9	1	The author organizes the article by starting off with an attention getter in the introduction. After the introduction the author startst to use a serious tone with the reader. He starts to define how the problem started.     The author then goes through and starts to emphasize the things that you read in the article. By the end of the article everything that you have read makes more sense because you everything has been defined previously in the article.

25296	9	2	The author organizes the article by first trying to get the reader's attention. He proclaims things such as 'Grab your telescope!' Then, the author begins to define how objects released in space will always orbit the planet, even after they have malfunctioned. This creates a 'great concern to government space agencies around the globe'. The author then addresses the topic of how space debris is created. for example when 'two communications satellites...both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hour' crashed, they produced hundreds of pieces of debris. Next, the author informs the reader of how these tiny pieces can be very harmful and dangerous. In addition to the danger they pose, 'the problem is certain to persist.' Last, the author includes facts on how this issue will worsen.
25297	9	1	he orgonizes it in sections. by doing this if a reeder wants to look back he can find a statement much easyer.
25298	9	2	The author first grabs the reader's attention by using a line from a Superman quote. He/she then turns into serious mode and talks about space explorations and how objects can be detached from an exploration. Then the author gives an example of a crash in space between two satelites that ran into eachother and made milions of tiny satelites. The author concludes the article by talking about what scientists can do to prevent space junk in the future.
25299	9	1	The author organizes the article by first describing what is space junk. Space junk is a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earht's atmosphere. Then the author simply tells about all the things that are included in the sapce junk.
25300	9	2	The author organizes the article into four sections: The introduction, which introduces the reader to space junk with an anecdotal occurence, 'What Is Space Junk?', which describes countless objects orbiting the Earth, 'Crash Course', which descibes the events of satellites and other orbiting objects crashing into eachother, and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains how serious space junk is, and what problems it can cause.
25301	9	0	The author organizes the artical from least important to most important.
25302	9	0	The author organizes the article with several different pieces of writing put into one. It makes this article a good read.
25303	9	2	The article is organized by certain topics. Each paragraph is about something specific. For example, the 'Crash Course' paragraph is mainly about collisons of the 'space junk.' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is about how smaller debris, moving at a high speed, can still cause a lot of damage.
25304	9	0	the way he got everything organized is like he got everything label and know where exactly where too go.
25305	9	2	The article follows cause-and-effect organizational pattern.  From the prelude in the introduction, it moves onto a description of the history of space travel; furthermore, it descbribes how a celestial satellite becomes 'space junk.'  In the last part of the article, entitled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' it explains how the microscopic pieces of loose material up in space can become a dangerous problem to travelling satellites.  From the cause of space pollution to the effect of dangerous environments in space travel, the organization helps to understand the nature of the problem at hand.  Furthermore, the article is divided into labeled sections describing the common themes for the compilations.
25306	9	0	The author ordanizes the article by cause and effect. he says that we send stuff into space but when we do some of the stuff becomes free flowing junk in space.

25310	9	1	The author organizes it in the same way I think I would if I was writing a paper on this topic.  To start off the article the author uses a funny statement ot try and drag the reader in, as seen in the first two lines.  Then he trys to inform the readers of the history of space travel and how the junk gets into space in the first place, as seen in the second paragraph.  Next the author tries to inform his readers about some of the major accidents that created alot of space junk, he does this when he explains the instance of the two satalites colliding.  Lastly the author tries to explain to the reader that the space junk may be small but it is very dangerous, as seen when the author says that the bits even though they are small present a very serios problem.

It also informs the readers how the crahses take place and at what speeds they take place at. The last section talks about why space junk is hard to stear clear of.
25314	9	2	The author uses an introduction to grab the readers attention.  The use some humorous dialogue to get the reader interested and to introduce the topic of the article.  The following section goes into detail about the focus of the article by explaining what space junk is and what it becomes.  Crash Course gives real examples to ellaborate the dangers of space junk such as when the two satellites collided with one another.  The final section discusses the current situation and overall impact that space junk has by giving the example of sand being blown by a breeze of blown out of a sandblaster.  This elaborates on the damage that small pieces of space junk can do.

25333	9	2	The author oranizes the article first to catch our attention. He then Goes into information about Space Junk and how it is harmful. After he talks about how dangerous crash courses are. Then he pursues to talk about how these things are little but a huge deal! The author is a very intelligant an organized man the article was fantastic.
25334	9	1	The author gives us detailed information about how satellites began and what happens to them if the would crash into another satellite. That the space trash form that crash would fall to earth or it go destory another satellite like a sandblaser blasting paint off concret. The tiny fragments would perice throught that object and possobly bring it down.
25335	9	1	IT TALKS ABOUT SPACE. AND HOW THE SPACE JUNK IS EVERYWHERE. IT ALSO TALKS ABOUT IT INCREASING BECASUE COMMERCIAL SPACE TRAVEL IS THE RISE AN MORE NATIONS HAVE UNDERTAKEN SPACE EXPLORATION.
25336	9	1	The auther tell us every thing we put in space will come back and hurt us one of these days. He thells us every thing that can go wrong. I tink we should stop puting our crap in space.
25337	9	1	he creates a organized paper of all the catagories he wanted to talk about it wasnt all cluttered together under one title he spaced it out.
25338	9	2	He first starts off with an intriguing introduction thats main purpose is to grab the reader's attention. He then goes in to a brief history of space exploration, and then how space debris is made. He then proceeds to give the reader multiple explanations on how space debris is harmful.
25339	9	1	He caught my attention in the introduction. Then he slowly filled my head with interesting facts about space junk in in the fourth and fifth paragraph of this passage. Then in the last two paragraphs, he talked about the seriousness about the junk in space.
25340	9	0	He starts out getting the reader attention and the gradually gets into more detail explaining how harmul space junk can be
25341	9	2	The author begins with an exciting introduction to grasp the reader's attention and keep them reading. Then, after the excitement is over, he addresses the topic seriously and describes the dangerous of 'space junk'.      While explaining this, the author divides different portions of the article by using sub-headings such as 'What Is Space Junk?' or 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' These sub-headings clarify the mainpoints for the reader and make the article easier to understand.
25342	9	1	It grabs your attetion in the introduction. It tells you a little bit of information about space exploration. It tells about the risks of objects running into each other. Also tells how the really small particles of space garbage pose a big problem.

25346	9	2	The author starts each paragraph with a different topic relating to space and the specific problems involving space. Like the second paragraph, which is called 'What Is Space Junk'? This paragraph is telling you what has been put into our space and what is making it crowded.
25347	9	1	The author organized this article in a very specific, yet unique style.  Instead of combining the article into one, the author put everything into a category.  One category can simplify the understanding of the text.  As the reader reading one category at a time helps with reading comprehension.     Perhaps the author had no clue as to how to combine everything into one, or had too much information to combine it all into one.  The first 'category' acts as an introduction while the second 'category' acts as the main story.  Yes, the author could have organized the article in a different way, but he stood out and made the text easier to understand.  I strongly believe that the author did this to get the reader drawn into the story.
25348	9	1	The author is talking about different facts in the article. So there're different headlines for ever subject.
27589	10	1	black :: This color could possibly make the dog house warmer.
27590	10	0	white ::  It will affect the doghouse by making it nice and fresh inside the doghouse
27591	10	1	white ::  brandi and jerry would have to paint the dogh ouse white because; the sun doesnt make alot of wite things hot. Cause on the data table it shows that the color white doesnt effect the sun alot since its a lighter color.
27592	10	2	white :: White does not absord as much light as a dark er color making the inside of the doghouse not as warm as it could be. In the experiment, the lowest temperature average was white with 42(DEG). The next temperature was light gray with 45(DEG), after that it just goe s up higher
27593	10	2	black :: I would pick black.This color will effect the dog house by keeping the dog house warm.My support is that in the data t able it shows that the Average temperature for the color black inside a g lass jar was 53(DEG)C And the lowest temperature was white and whites Av rage data was42(DEG)C. Dark Grey and Light Grey had a median of 48(DEG) C for Dark Grey and 45(DEG)C for Light grey.This shows that the Black co lor would keep the dog the most warmest
27594	10	1	dark gray ::  Using dark gray would make the dog house an average of 48(DEG)C. If you used black it would be too hot in the summer but if you used white it would be too cold in the winter, and the reason why I didn't choose light gray is because the dog would most likely be in the dog house at night when it's colder and not so much during the day, especially in the summer.
27595	10	1	light gray :: By using this color for the doghouse it will have the perfect temperature inside the doghouse because it will be abou t 45(DEG) inside, which isn't too cold or too hot and that might make th e dog happy.
27596	10	2	white :: If the color of the dog house was white then the air temperature inside of it would be cooler than if the color was black. The averge temp. for the color black was 53(DEG) C, and the average temp. for the color white was 42(DEG) C. The difference between them is 11(DEG).
27597	10	2	white ::  White paint would keep the doghouse cool. You know this because white had the lowest average air temperature after ten minutes under the lamp.
27598	10	1	white ::  it dose not absorb the light as much
27599	10	1	black :: i say it should be black.First of all because ,lesser air will go inside the doghouse, since its ah more darker color a nd pluz it has an average of 54(DEG) in average of heat inside a glass j ar.
27600	10	1	dark gray ::  The dog house will be hot due to the absorbst ion of heat from the color of the house,this will help the dog stay warme r during cold nights and the winters.
27601	10	1	white :: It will keep the heat out of the doghouse bec ause white reflects heat and will keep the doghouse cool. I know th is because of how the white jar heated up the slowest in the experiment.
27602	10	2	black ::  Black could affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will keep the dog house very warm so the dog won't get cold. I think this is true because according to the data the average temperatu re of a black color was 53(DEG)C, which was the high data and the average temperature for the white col or was only 42(DEG)C, which is the low data. And the black temperature w as 11(DEG) warmer then the white temperature. so that means the black co lor will keep the dog warm.
27603	10	2	black ::  if they paint the doghouse black then the dog could sleep in it overnight because of the warmth. the average tem perature of the black jar was 53 degrees while the white jar was on ly 42 degrees.
27604	10	1	white :: dogs have a lot of fur to keep them warm so o n a summer day they want to cool down. Black is not a good chose because it asbordes a lot heat white does not. The color white will affect the do g house by being less hot then a black dog house will be.
27605	10	1	dark gray :: Its Would Be About An Average Temperature. It s Not 2 Hot Or 2 Cold.
27606	10	1	dark gray :: Dark gray might affect the doghouse because i t would warm up the dog without the dog getting to hot.
27607	10	1	light gray :: this cler would keep the dog house cool and k eep a little warmpth in side
27608	10	2	black ::  This color will keep the dog house warmer bec ause it has a lower albedo. Also in the experiment it had the highest of the Average tempertures with 53(DEG).
27609	10	0	dark gray :: tgfyfgfgccghjhjhgcgtchfhjfgfcc
27610	10	1	white ::  from the results i would pick white because i t was the coolest (as in temperature).that way the dog would be able to s tay in a place thats not to hot and it provide protection from the sun.th e lighter colors absorb less heat other than the darker colors so it shou ldent be that hot.so they should paint the dog house white or any other l ighter color but not the darker colors.
27611	10	0	black :: it wont
27612	10	0	white :: The white color will be the best because it i s not as dark as black and white absorbs less heat than black, the dog house will be about the same temperature as the outside with the white paint. The showing results of white is that it collects less heat energy than the other darker colors.
27613	10	2	black ::  Having a black doghouse would make the doghou se warmer on the inside. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment, using a black lid had an average of 53(DEG) C, while the othere lighter colors had ave rages of 48, 45, and 42(DEG) C. Therefore, using black would be the best choice for a doghouse color.
27614	10	0	light gray ::  If the doghouse was black or dark gray it mig ht get to hot for the dog. If it was white it might be to cold for the do g so i decided that ligh gay was a good color.
27615	10	2	white :: The color white might effect the doghouse by causing the air temperature to be low in the summer since lighter colors obsorb less energy this is proven because a black lid averaged 53(DEG)c and the white lid averaged a 42(DEG)c, wich is in fact much cooler than the black lid temperature.
27616	10	1	white :: I choose white for the colopr of the dog hous e,because that way it wont be so hot for the dog.In the experiment Brandi and Jerry found the lighter the color,the less sun it atracts.
27617	10	1	light gray :: I would use light gray becuase its more on th e cooler side for tempature and it wont over heat it when the suns if we would to be laying in his dog house.
27618	10	1	white ::  It will keep the inside of the doghouse from getting to warm during the summer.
27619	10	0	light gray ::  It might fit because black wouldnt go eit the dog if the dog is a light color then a light gray if the dog is a drak c olor then drak gray would match him but the draker color the more they di e it would be better if the doghouse was light gray because the lighter c olors dont make you sweat more
27620	10	0	black :: the dog house will not affect the dog house t he black paint for the doghouse will keep it cool.
27621	10	2	white :: White would be a good color beacause it would make the dog house be fresh inside not so hot. Acording to the data tabl e white got the lowest average air tempature for how hot it gets bu t black got the most highest.
27622	10	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house w hite because the jar with the white lid had the lowest temperature inside the jar, and its average was 42(DEG) C. This way the inside of the dog house will stay cool and not get to hot.
27623	10	1	white ::  I think that if they were building a dog hous e they should use a white paint color, because then the doghouse will be cool instead of hot because the paint is lighter.
27624	10	2	white :: The wite paint will keep the dog house cooler , because in the experiment, the white paint had the lowest tempurature a fter ten minuutes, being 11 degrees cooler than the black paint, with a t emp of 54 degrees.
27625	10	1	dark gray :: Dark gray was the most consistant energy absorber. With an average of 48(DEG)C the dog house will not be too cold or hot and is capeable of maintaing an consistent temperature all year long.
27626	10	1	white :: i choose the color white because if it is a s unny day outside and the dog wants some shade he will go in the dog house because the white does not attracted energy as much as black. the dog ho use will be nice and cool for the dog.
27627	10	1	white ::  it would stay cooler than a darker one would because it doesn't absorb energy like a darker one would.
27628	10	1	light gray ::  Using the light gray paint would be good beca use its still dark to the point where it will collect energy but not a wh ole lot to the point where the dog is dieing from the heat, but not light enough to the point where the dog isn't getting any energy from the sun.
27629	10	2	white ::  The color of the dog house could affect the t emperature makeing the dog house cooler. this is true because in the expe riment the white colored jar was the coldest with and average of 42(DEG) c.
27630	10	1	light gray :: The color, light gray, will make the doghouse cool in the summer and still keep it a little warm in the summer.
27631	10	2	white ::  White will make it cooler in there so when its sunny out the dog can go in there and won't burn up. After 10 minutes the white lid averaged 42 degrees so that means its cooler then the black lid which after 10 minutes averaged 53 degrees
27632	10	0	black :: The color might affect the outside of the dog house because in the summer it might get lighter and the winter it might get darker
27633	10	2	white ::  White would be the best color because white will keep the inside of the dog house at the coolest temperature. In the experement, the black lid caused the inside of the jar to be at an a verage of 53(DEG)C and the white lid caused it to be an average of 42(DEG) C. If the outside was black the dog house would be too hot and if it is white the house will be cool enough for the dog to live in.
27634	10	2	white ::  The inside of the dog house after being painted white might make the doghouse be colder. In the data it says trial 1 and next to white it says 42(DEG)C. In trial 3 it had 41(DEG)C. The average temperature of white was 42(DEG)C the lowest average out of every color.
27635	10	2	white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is whit e because the temperature is not too hot when put under light. Black woul d not be a suitable color for the doghouse because its average temperatur e under a lamp for ten minutes is 53(DEG)C ; which is too hot. White pai nt however has an average of 42(DEG)C when put under a lamp for ten minu tes. This means that with a white doghouse, the dog wouldn't over heat.
27636	10	1	dark gray ::  The color gray would absorb only some of the lights enery for heat, not as much as black and since dogs have thick coa ts you dont want it to be too hot inside the doghouse. Also it gets cold in the winter and Brandi and jerry's dog their building a house for might not have a really thick fur and it would be neccesary to be at 0least so mewhat warm in the doghouse. Thats why gray would be the best color.
27637	10	2	white :: Because in the summer, the white color will d eflect the sun's heat, keeping the doghouse 10(DEG) cooler than if you w ould paint it black, because in the experiment, the air temperature insid e of the jar with the white lid stayed in the low 40's, while the jar wit h the black lid stayed in the low-mid 50's, proving the white deflects he at, while black asorbs it.
27638	10	1	white ::  the doghouse will stay cooler on the inside.
27639	10	1	white ::  the color white would effect the doghouse's i nside in a way were it would absorb less heat therore it would be cooler in the inside of the dog house.
27640	10	1	black :: the darker color will keep most of the heat i n the dog house than the color white would. the increase of the heat is b ecause of the darker color in the dog house.
27641	10	1	white :: The paint color that i choose is white i chos se this color because it will not make the inside of the dog house as hot . The color might affect the inside of the dog house because white does n ot absorb as much heat as a darker color would. In the summer in stead of it getting up to 53(DEG) C with black paint it will be a cooler 42(DEG) C with the white paint
27642	10	2	black ::  The black paint will keep the dog warm inside the doghouse during winter, just like how the black jare lid heated the air in the jar 11(DEG)C higher than the jarwith a white lid.
27643	10	2	light gray :: the doghouse wouldnt be too cold or too hot. i got this data from the table they made of all the adverages
27644	10	2	light gray :: The light gray is a good color to choose beca use it won't be too hot in the summer and won't be too cold in the winter . The light gray was the 2nd coldest jar.
27645	10	2	white :: the color will keep the dog cooler and will n ot get the dog really hot.In the expirement it says that it got down to 4 1(DEG)C.And the lowest for others was 44(DEG)C.
27646	10	1	white :: The temperatur would be lower, because in the experiment the white lid had a temperature 11(DEG) below that of the bl ack lid
27647	10	1	white :: i think white becaause white reflects the sun so its not as hot inside the dog house.
27648	10	0	white ::  to keep the dog house cooler a black dog hous e
27649	10	1	white :: because black attracts more heat than white
27650	10	0	dark gray :: Because the results of their experiment showe d that a dark color attracts more sunlight, it would be best to have a da rk gray paint. Although, dark colors would be a very bad idea for hot sun ny days because it would become extremely hot inside of the doghouse and the dog would begin to dehydrate and would have to have it's waterdish re filled two times a day. But, with a light gray paint on the doghouse, the dog would be able to stay cool during summertime!
27651	10	2	white :: the color white is the best choice because it will keep the doghouse colder. A white jar kept the jar cooler by 11 deg rees.
27652	10	2	white :: this color will affect the dog by keeping the dog cool in the summer.becaus the darker the lid color,the greater the i ncrease in air tempeture...
27653	10	1	light gray :: this color would effect the dog house by keep ing the air warm and cold so it would be the right temerature.
27654	10	1	white ::  I would make it much cooler for the dog in hi s new dog house.
27655	10	1	white ::  th white paint will keep the dog house cool w hen it gets hot outside
27656	10	2	white :: The color white might affect the inside of th e dog house to be cooler. The average of the three trials for white was l ower than the average of the other colors,white was 3(DEG)c cooler than light gray and as much as 11(DEG)c cooler than the black.
27657	10	0	white :: because white draws the least amount of energ y
27658	10	1	dark gray ::  The best color to paint the doghouse would be dark gray, because dog houses are usually meant to keep dogs warm. Dark gray would absorb enough sunlight to make the inside warm, but not hot. Therefore the dog would be most comfortable with the color dark gray.
27659	10	2	white :: If the doghouse was painted white, the inside of the doghouse wouldn't get to hot for the dog. This is because i n the data table the average temerature for the light gray lid color was 42(DEG) C. Also, if the doghouse was painted black or any of the other c olors, the dog would possibly get to hot because they are darker colors t hat absorbs more energy.
27660	10	1	dark gray ::  It will warm the doghouse, and help the dogho use contain a consistant tempeture, at 54(DEG) C
27661	10	1	white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler because in the expirament white had the lowest average temperature when it was pu t under the light for 10 minutes.
27662	10	2	white :: I think the best paint color for the doghouse is white. I believe that since white is the lighest color of paint they have, it will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler. The lighter the col or, the less heat it will asorb. In the data, the average temperature of the air inside the glass jar when the lid was white was 42(DEG)C. For bl ack, the darkest color lid they had, the average temperature of the air w as 53(DEG)C. That's a total difference of 11(DEG)C.
27663	10	1	black ::  the color black would keep the dog house warm er.
27664	10	1	black ::  Black is a good color to use because it absorbs heat. It would make the inside of the dog house warm, much like the hot lamp experiment. In the lab the lamp became hot because the black lid absorbed heat from the lamp. I think the black paint will absorb heat from the sun and make the dog house warm inside.
27665	10	1	white :: this color would be best because it would not get as hot as a darker color such as black making it better suited for the dog
27666	10	1	black ::  it will make the dog house warmer.
27667	10	1	light gray ::  They should paint it light gray because, tha t color attracts heat but not so much that it would get so hot in there i n the summer, and not too cold in the winter.
27668	10	1	dark gray :: this color might affect the doghouse by absor bing energy from the sun but you dont want black because you dont want it to hot for the dog.
27669	10	0	light gray :: it might make it look not as good but it will also be cooler because black lets the heat in not out . it will also be lighter inside at night.
27670	10	2	black :: I would choose black for the paint color beca use the black paint would absorb the heat energy from the sun and heat up the inside of the doghouse. The black lid had an average tempurature of 53(DEG)C, which was the highest average tempurature out of all the lids, and the white had a tempurature of 42(DEG)C, which was the lowest. They had a difference of 11(DEG)C, meaning that the black paint would keep t he doghouse warmer.
27671	10	1	white ::  i say white because is attracs less hot
27672	10	1	white ::  The color white might affect the doghouse because inside the doghouse the temperature will be lower than if using the paint color to be black.
27673	10	1	white :: white does not absorb as much energy as the o ther colors so the doghouse would be colder inside.
27674	10	1	black :: i chosed black because it will keep the house warm because on the table it clearly states that black absorbs more ener gy
27675	10	0	light gray :: when the dog house gets dirty it wont show th e parts that are dirty because its the color black
27676	10	2	light gray :: The light gray paint color would be the best because of the fact that if the dog was in the dog house it would not be too hot nor too cold. The data shows that the average tempreaure of the p ain is as follows Black:53(DEG)c Dark Grey:48(DEG)c Light Grey:45(DEG)c White:42(DEG)c so you see that with the ligth grey it still will absorbe some light, so it wont be to hot or to cold in there... the light grey is a perfect inbewteen temprature for the dog house because to much heat for an animal is not good and so it to little heat.
27677	10	0	dark gray :: dark gray was the only color that didn't eith er decrease or increase in temperature during the Hot Lamp experiment. If the built a dog house dark gray the inside of the dog house wouldn't ove r heat.
27678	10	1	white :: They should use white as a color because it w ill not be as hot in the dog house than with a black dog house.Darker col ors asborb energy and lighter color dont so white would be a good choice.
27679	10	1	white ::  The color white would affect the doghouse bet ter because the doghouse will stay cooler.
27680	10	2	white ::  It will keep it the coolest out of all the co lors. The temp for white was 41 to 43 while the other colrs were rangeing to 44 to 54(DEG)
27681	10	1	light gray :: I think that Light Gray would be best because it attrack some heat so during the winter it will be warm. Then later, d uring the summer it will take in some heat but it won't take in enough to heat the dog up alot so he will stay at a pretty well kept temperature.
27682	10	1	white :: it will keep it cooler
27683	10	2	white :: White would be the best color for the doghous e because white absorbs less energy which would make the doghouse cooler for the dog. According to the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage air temperature of 42(DEG) C while the black lid had an average air temperature of 53(DEG) C.
27684	10	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint thier doghouse white because the inside of the doghouse will stay cool even during the s ummer. the data shows that the white lids average heat temperture was abo ut 42 C and the black was about 53 C. white was 11 degrees cooler.
27685	10	2	black :: with black paint the dog would have a warmer dog hose because black absorbs heat. In the experiment the temperature fo r the black lid was always the highest.
27686	10	2	black :: That color would provide the warmest environm ent for the dog in the doghouse, because the black paint would create the warmest air temperature. In the experiment, the jar with the black lid r eached an average of 53(DEG), which was 5(DEG) more than the next highe st temperature. (48(DEG))
27687	10	1	black ::  it would effect in the heat because it would be warmer
27688	10	1	white :: the white house wouldbe better becauseit refl ects light way better than black because it absorbs the light, causing it to get hotter
27689	10	1	white :: White would keep it cooler in the doghouse lo nger.
27690	10	1	white ::  It will let the dog cool down on a hot day faster.
27691	10	2	white ::  The average temperature from the glass jar experiment for the color white was 42 degrees. This is the lowest temperature out of the four colors (Black, Dark gray, Light gray and Whit e). Using the color White would reflect the suns heat, causing the doghouse to be cool and not overheat. Therefore, creating a safe doghouse habitat.
27692	10	0	black ::  fdddfddf
27693	10	2	white ::  the color will effect the dog house by keeping it cooler than the other colors because in the expiriment the white lid always had the lowest temperature.
27694	10	1	dark gray :: I believe that the dark gray would be a good paint color for the dog house because depending on where they live, that dog house woudn't be too hot, nor cold
27695	10	1	light gray :: The Color Will Effect By Having Black And Whi te Mix Because Black Brings Heat And White Is Cooling Color And Mix Them The Dog HoUSE Would Be Warm
27696	10	0	black :: After a while the doghouse color might fade o ut.
27697	10	1	dark gray ::  the color i chose till make the dog house war m but not to hot and dark gray stayed the same temperature at 48 for all 4 trials
27698	10	0	dark gray ::  when the heat stays the same outside it will stay the same inside too.
27699	10	1	black ::  Using black paint color on the dog house will increase the temperature inside the dog by a few degrees, making it more comfortable for the dog.
27700	10	1	light gray :: The light gray might affect the doghouse but not too much because the light gray is almost at about room temperature. If you put black in there, it will be too hot. If you put white in there it might be too cold.
27701	10	2	white ::  By making the doghouse white, the air inside the doghouse would be cooler than with any other color. In the experiment Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, the jar with the white lid was only an average of 42(DEG) C after 10 minutes of heating. The jar with the black lid, however, was an average of 53(DEG) C after 10 minut es of heating. The jar with the white lid was an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefor, the color white will make the doghouse cooler inside and is the best color for the doghouse.
27702	10	1	black ::  it will make it hot in the dog hopuse
27703	10	2	white ::  The color white would make the dog house absorb less heat and make it cooler. Acording to the experiment black got 53(DEG)C and white got 42(DEG)C so it should do the same with the dog house.
27704	10	1	black :: i think balck so it willl keep it insolated a nd warm for the dog
27705	10	2	"white ::  I would choose black because in the ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar"" Table It Showed That Wh ite was Colder than black and The rest Of the darker colors. For example the average for white was 42(DEG)C and the average for black was 5 3(DEG)C."
27706	10	1	white :: i would pick a white dog house because the white jar lid had the least amout of tempature increase. it only had about a an 18(DEG)C increese while the black jar lid had a 29(DEG) C increase.
27707	10	1	white ::  white will reflect the heat so the dog house will be cool
27708	10	1	white :: The white panit Because if you panit it a dak er color the results would be a hoter dog house and the resluts for a whi te dog house would be a cooler house.
27709	10	1	black ::  how it can affect is that when is reallly hot outside the dogshouse can get really warm or like hot cause the sun is absorbing more energy.
27710	10	2	dark gray :: i think that brandi and jerry should use the color dark gray because if its summer and its really hot then it wont be to hot for the dog and wen its winter the dog can still be worm inough be cause the air inside in a jar like it shows in lid color vs. air temperat ure inside a glass jar the medium colors that are not to hot or to warm i s dark gray and light gray so eather of them is fine because u wouldnt wa nt the dog to freez to death and u wouldnt want it to hot
27711	10	2	white :: It will keep the doghouse cool and not hot. W hen Brandi and Jerry put the white lid on, the average temperature inside the jar was 42(DEG) C. When they put the black jar on, the average temp erature was 53(DEG) C.
27712	10	1	black :: black because the color black atracs the heat and it gets realy hot.
27713	10	1	white ::  If the doghouse was white the temperature in the doghouse would be so much cooler than if the doghouse was black. White would be best for the doghouse because you would not want it to be too warm.White would fit the best.
27714	10	0	white :: white color will deflec more sunlight
27715	10	1	white :: White will not affect the doghouse because in the results in the experiment, it shows that white was the lowest temper ature than all the temperatures of different lid colors.
27716	10	1	black :: It will be warmer for the dog
27717	10	2	white ::  White would be the best choise because it att racts less heat as shown in the experiment the jar with the white lid onl y got up to 43(DEG)C at the highest, and the black lid got up to 54(DEG) C at the highest. And the dark grey and light grey were inbetween.
27718	10	2	white ::  Painting the doghouse white would make it cooler inside the doghouse. I know this because the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was 42(DEG)C and the average temperatures for the other colored jars were all equal to or above 45(DEG)C.
27719	10	0	white :: because it has the least amount of air pressu re
27720	10	2	black ::  painting your dog house this color will affec t the inside by making it hotter is what i get from the chart and the res ults the kids who did this project.0
27721	10	1	light gray :: Light gray doesn't asorb as much heat as Blac k or Dark gray, which would help keep the doghouse cool in the summer tim e. It also asorbs some heat, at least more than white, which would help k eep the doghouse from getting too cold in the winter. This makes it the o ptimal paint to use when designing a doghouse.
27722	10	1	white :: it will keep the doghouse cool.
27723	10	2	light gray :: If they use light grey then the doghouse will stay cooler because if the color of the paint is dark then it will absor b more heat as it did in the lamp experiment.
27724	10	0	white :: I think white because in the summer time the dog house is not to hot for the dog house and warm air can come inside the dog house door to make the inside a little wwarmer.
27725	10	1	white :: The color white would reflect the light on th e house, instead of absorbing it like the black would, keeping the house cool inside.
27726	10	0	white :: the white one will reflect more heat than the other colors
27727	10	2	black :: i would chose a black for the doghouse beacus e the air temperature would be hotter, therefore keeping the dog warmer i n the winter time. i know this because in brandi and jerry's experiment, when the lid was black, the average air temperature was 53(DEG) celsius, and when the lid was white, the average air temperature was 42(DEG) celcius,
27728	10	1	black :: They should use black paint for their doghous e. In the experiment, the iar inside the jar was 5(DEG)C warmer than the second warmest color.The jar with the black lid was 53(DEG)C.
27729	10	2	white :: It would keep the doghouse cool in the summer . after ten minutes the jar with the white lid was on average, only 42(DEG) C. The jar with the black lid however had an aver age of 53(DEG)C after ten m inutes. This would be much too hot for the dog.
27730	10	1	black :: using black paint it will increase the tempat ure in the house so that their dog will stay warm
27731	10	1	white :: the color white does not absorbed energy from the sun. the color will make the dog house cooler instead of if you make the top black it will be as hot as an oven inside the dog house.
27732	10	0	dark gray :: my color is dark gray it might effect the inside because its gonna make it look scary in there
27733	10	2	black ::  It would increase the temperature of the dogh ouse, especially when close to light. Because darker colors make more hea t. For ecample, when Brandi and Jerry were doing the experiment on the lid colo rs. Black had the highest amount of heat. This is mostly because its an energy transfer. When light hits darker colors, it turns in to th ermal and or heat energy.
27734	10	2	light gray ::  Light gray could effect the tempature of the doghouse because draker colors absorb more heat than light colors do. If Brandi and Jerry were to paint the dog house black, the house would absor b too much heat since in the data the average was 53((DEG)C), if you cho se dark gray the average tempatrure was 48((DEG)C) which could still be too warm. If you chose light gray, its average was 45((DEG)C) which is r ight in the middle of being warm and cold and if you were to use white, t he average was 42((DEG)C) which could be too cold in the winter time. Th erefore, using the light gray could help keep the doghouse warm and cool and the same time.
27735	10	0	light gray :: in the winter the dog might get cold so you m ake it a sort of light color so it can stay warmer. In the summer it will be hot and the dog will want to be cooler so you pick a sort of light co lor
27736	10	0	dark gray :: drak gray will not over heat the dog or chang e its temperature
27737	10	2	light gray :: Light gray would atract more energy than whit e which would keep it warmer but it would also stay cooler than black or dark gray.
27738	10	1	light gray :: I think that the best color for a dog house w ould probably be light grey, that way inside the dog house wouldn't be to o hot or too cold. If the dog house was white, inside the dog house would probably be too cold since white doesn't absorb as much energy. I wouldn 't paint the dog house black though because it might get too hot, same wi th dark grey. So light grey would be the best color for a dog house.
27739	10	1	white ::  Since the color white's average was 42(DEG)C (the coolest temperature), it would be the best choice. Since white doesn't get as much heat, the dog in the doghouse would be cooler than in a darker colored doghouse.
27740	10	1	white :: Choose WHITE!!! because it won't absorb much heat like black does 54(DEG) will make the dog house too hot. White is g ood because its a nice 41(DEG)
27741	10	1	white :: becuase white gathers less energy which will make it cooler inside than any of the other colors.
27742	10	2	black :: Using black paint to paint a doghouse would a bsorb more heat, as the data from the experiment shows. In the experiment , the jar with the black lid heated up to 53(DEG) on average, while whit e only heated up to 42(DEG) on average.
27743	10	2	white :: white is the best choice of color because the average temputre was 42 so comparing that to the black which is 53 the d og house would be cooler with white pant
27744	10	1	white :: On the graph, white is the one that had the c oolest tempature, because the light went right through the color, so it d idn't get really hot. As shown on the graph.
27745	10	1	white :: using a white color on the dog house will dec rese the amound of heat coming into the dog hous ther for it will k eep the dog house more cooler then those darker color's this is becouse w hite absorbs no color but its self
27746	10	2	black ::  if you choose black then inside the dog house will be very hot because in the experiment, the darker the color, the mo re hot it got inside the jar because dark colors absorb energy.
27747	10	1	black :: cuz will keep dog warm
27748	10	0	white :: it is to lite so it wouldent let of as much l ite.
27749	10	1	black :: black atracts heat
27750	10	1	white :: keep it cool
27751	10	2	white :: White is the best choice since the highest te mperaure was in the black jar at 54(DEG), and the lowest was in the whit e jar at 43(DEG) showing an 11(DEG) difference, keeping the dog less ho t in his house.
27752	10	0	dark gray :: because it can capture some sunlight
27753	10	2	white ::  I think that the doghouse should be painted white because the lighter colors reflect more light energy than the dark. The average temperature of black lided jars was 53(DEG). The average of the white jars was 42(DEG). The dogs should live in a house that wont absorb too much energy so they wont overheat.
27754	10	1	white :: it wont be so hot
27755	10	2	white :: They should paint the doghouse white because in the data it showed that white was always the coldest in every trial an d if they did black the dog would always be hot.
27756	10	1	light gray :: inside the doghouse in the summer it will kee p it somewat cool and in the winter it will keep it somewat warm. also it was (in my opinion) the central temperature of them all being 45(DEG) C .
27757	10	1	white :: if they made a white doghouse the air tempatu re would not be as hot is if they made the dog house black because lighte r colors absorb less light.
27758	10	1	dark gray :: It would keep it warm in the wonter and cold in the summer so the dog wouldn't be to hot or to cold.
27759	10	1	light gray :: this color would keep the dog house cool in t he summer and in the winter would still help heat the house the house wou ld be warmer if thw color was black
27760	10	0	black ::  The color might affect the inside tempature of the doghouse because the darkness provdes a type of covering that is like a insulation.
27761	10	1	white ::  white would absorb less energy in the doghous e making it cooler inside the doghouse
27762	10	1	light gray :: it will make it so it's nice and warm at nigh t but still has enough heat retaned at night to keep him/her warm
27763	10	0	black :: If the coloris darker it will absorb energy
27764	10	2	black ::  If you were to chose black as your paint colo r, it woul warmer than the dark gray, light gray and white. In this expe riment black got about 53(DEG)C and the white got 42(DEG)C.
27765	10	1	light gray :: well if u have a darker color like black for an exampl it could be way too hot in the mid-day, but if u have a light color like white for an example it would probably be way to cold at night so a light gray color would be the just right tempature
27766	10	1	white :: Painting the doghouse white would allow the d oghouse to stay cooler in the summer so that the dogs do not get too hot inside.
27767	10	0	light gray :: I chose light gray because dog's eyesight onl y contains black and white sight, they dont see color like humans do. So a light gray dog house will catch dogs attention.
27768	10	1	light gray ::  This color will make the doghouse stay cooler when it is warm and sunny, but it will also create heat when it is cold.
27769	10	1	light gray :: This color can effect the doghouse by keeping it cool but to to cold and not to hot, becuase dark gray or black will o ver heat the dog, because of there fur.
27770	10	1	dark gray :: because it wasint the hotest or coldest tempi ture so it wouldent be to hot or cold in the dog house it had steady resu lts
27771	10	2	white ::  The white color would let the inside of the doghouse be cooler than the other types of paint because the white lid's average temp. was 42(DEG) C and the black lid's average temp. was 53(DEG) C. that is an 11(DEG) differance for the dog to feel.
27772	10	0	white :: because if you have a dark color the light wi ll make it hot for he dog.
27773	10	2	white :: The white paint color will reflect off heat a nd not absorb as much energy as the black paint which is a good paint col or for the summer. The white paint color average for the temperature is 4 2(DEG)C, while the black paint color average for the temperatue is 53(DEG) C.
27774	10	0	black :: Might affect the doghouse look nice for the d og
27775	10	1	white :: it wouldn't heat up so fast
27776	10	2	black :: I chose the color black for the doghouse beca use from the data collected, black was warmer than any other color with a n average temperature of 53(DEG)C compared to the lowest temperature of 42(DEG)C for the color white. The dog in the house will stay warmer beca use black is the warmest color which I know by looking at the data Brandi and Jerry collected.
27777	10	1	dark gray :: i think that dark gray could be the color bec ause it woulld not be to cold or to hot. So in the summer the dog house c ould stay cool, and in the winter it could stay warm.
27778	10	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because it will keep the i nside of the doghouse from being 2 warm if they live in an extremel y hot place. The average temperature of the jar in the light gray jar was 45(DEG)C. So it is enough to keep the dog warm, but not enough to make it uncomfortable.
27779	10	2	white ::  White reflects energy instead of absorbing it like other colors. It also had the lowest air temperature inside in the jar of all three lids. This would make the doghouse cooler inside and more comfortable for the dogs inside.
27780	10	1	white :: white because after 10 minutes of heat it get s to about 42(DEG) C and dogs should have cooling temperature, not hot.
27781	10	1	dark gray :: because it will keep the dog house warm
27782	10	1	light gray :: the dog house can eather be hot or cold so th ere isn't much of a difference in the heat amount in the dog house.
27783	10	2	light gray :: The light gray color I think would be the bes t color to paint the dog house because the light gray color would absorb some heat enery to keep the dog warm but would also keep the dog cooler t han black or dark gray and warmer than the white. From the experiment the light gray lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C while the blac k lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C and the dark gray lid had a n average temperature of 48(DEG)C. The white lid had an average temperat ure of 42(DEG)C. The white color would keep the dog cool but the white c olor would reflect most of the heat energy which would in turn no make th e doghouse warm when needed.
27784	10	1	light gray :: the light grey soaks up heat but not too much .
27785	10	1	white :: this color might affect the dog house by not getting that much air inside. white has the lowest average tempeture whic h is 42(DEG)C
27786	10	2	white ::  I chose white because it would make it for a cooler house for the dog. Acording to the data table shown, it says that the white lid will produce less heat than the other colors.
27787	10	2	white :: i belive white will work the best because it doesnt conduct as much heat as the orther one s did: for exsample:b lack,drak grey,light gray, all got imbetween 44 and 54 well while the whi te paint only got 42-41 and 42 as an aveage
27788	10	2	black :: If Brandi and Jerry pick the black roof then the inside of the doghouse is going to be hotter than if they were to pic k the dark grey, light grey or white roof. In the expirement, when Brandi and Jerry used the black lid, the temperature got up to 54(DEG)c and wi th the dark grey lid, it only got up to 48(DEG)c, with the light grey l id, the tempertature got up to 46(DEG)c, and with the white lid, the tem perature only got up to 43(DEG)c, so most likely the black roof would ma ke the inside of the dog house hot.
27789	10	2	black ::  A black roof will keep the doghouse warm.The average temperature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C, but the average for t he next highest color was 48(DEG)C. Therefore, a black roof will keep th e dog at least 5(DEG)C warmer than any other color.
27790	10	1	dark gray ::  Dark grey would keep it to a cool temperature, but not too cold, and not too warm. Which is good for a dog.
27791	10	2	white ::  I chose white becuase it's the coolest and dogs have a lot of fur, so then they can escape the sun in a shady, cool dog house.There was quite a big difference between black which got up to 54 degrees C and white whos highest was 43. In the winter they will have a big fur coat , so they won't need it warm inside their dog house, plus there isn't as much sun. If its too cold they can go inside the house.
27792	10	0	black :: because it increases the engery
27793	10	0	white ::  this color might affect the doghouse by makin g it more ditry and reflecting off of the walls and see light coming from every where.
27794	10	0	white :: so you can see the dog in its house
27795	10	2	light gray ::  I think Light Gray would be the best paint co lor because it's not going to make the dog house that hot but you also do n't want it to be to cold so it's a comfortable temperature.Light G ray averaged about 45(DEG) C while white averaged 42(DEG) C,Dark Gray a t 48(DEG) C, and Black at 53(DEG) C.
27796	10	2	light gray ::  It will keep the dog warm but not as hot as u sing Black or Dark Grey paint, The average temp for Black is 53(DEG) and the average for the Light Grey paint is 45(DEG) an 8(DEG) difference.
27797	10	1	white :: they dog house would be cooler and not has ho t as a black or darker color dog house would be making it better to be in on a hot day
27798	10	1	black ::  Black is the best color to choose because in the experiment, it said that the black lid attracted the most heat so the y should use black paint to trap heat in the doghouse for the dog.
27799	10	1	black :: It would make the doghouse's temperature rise .
27800	10	2	white :: White paint would effect the dog house becaus e the lighter the colour the less heat is absorbed. According to the data , the difference in temperature would be around 11 degreees Centigrade th en the black colour. So the white colour would absorb less heat resulting in a less hot doghouse.
27801	10	2	dark gray ::  Dark gray is the best choice because its not to hot and its not to cold. The average tempture is 48(DEG)c and the oth er are 53,45 and 42
27802	10	1	black ::  black would ceep the house warm wene the uv r ays hit it they colect all the energy wich is in other words heat
27803	10	1	white :: white would work good cause that way the dogh ouse wont get to hot and it would be more comfortable.
27804	10	2	white :: The best color to paint a dog house would be white becuase white reflects heat from the sun which causes the dog house to become cooler in temperature. My support to my statement is in trial 1 The white white lid jar was the least in temperature becuase the white lidded jar was 42(DEG)C and the Light gray lidded jar was 44(DEG)C and the Dark Gray lidded jar was 48(DEG)C and the Black lidded jar was 54(DEG)C also in all the other trials the wjite lidded jar was cooler i n temperature then the diffrent color lidded jars. So Brandi and Jerry sh ould pick White to color there dog house if they want the dog house to be cooler in temperature so there dog wouldn't get too hot and die.
27805	10	2	white :: the white color will be much cooler then the other colors because, in the experiment the darker colors made the inside of the jar hotter. but the white color hade the lowest temperture which would be the ideal color for a dog house.
27806	10	1	dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray. This color may affect the inside of the doghouse because it would either keep it warmer or cooler, depending on the weather. The resu lts from the experiment say that the dark gray lid made the jar 48(DEG) C. in ten minutes, so it would keep the doghouse warm. It really just dep ends on the climate of where the dog live.
27807	10	1	light gray :: I picked light gray because I think the black and dark gray doghouse would absorb too much energy and make it too hot for a dog to be in. Whereas the light gray doghouse won't be too hot or t oo cold.
27808	10	1	white ::  White would be the best color because when it is summer and it gets hot the inside will be cool because black absorbs sun while white reflexs sun
27809	10	0	dark gray :: if there is dirt in the dog house it would be hard to see it
27810	10	2	white ::  By choosing a white color for the dog house i t will keep the dog cooler. I know this because in the experiment t he average temperature in the jar with a black lid was 53, but the averag e temperature in the jar with a white lid was 42. Therefore the darker th e paint color the warmer the dog house.
27811	10	2	white :: The best color for the doghouse would be whit e, because it absorbs less energy than a black color, and the black lid a verage was 53(DEG) C and the white lid was 42(DEG) C.
27812	10	1	white :: The color white will effect the dog house bec ause the white paint will reflect more white then black paint would. So t he white doghouse will be cooler in temerature.
27813	10	1	white :: it would be much cooler than if it was black
27814	10	0	white :: White color doesn't absorb as much light as b lack. Black color get hotter by direct sunlight because it is abosorbing it while white color simply reflects the light so it stays at about the s ame temperature.
27815	10	1	light gray :: the light gray color might prevent it from be ing either too cold or to hot. Also in the results, the color gray was the s econd to least heated of them all.
27816	10	1	white ::  it will make the dog house cooler than if you used black paint because white paint doesnt absorb that much energy
27817	10	2	white :: The dog house will be cooler if painted White and more comfortable for a dog. In the experiment the temperatures for the jars(in (DEG)C) with the black lid were 53, dark gey 48, light grey 45, and white 42. The White was 11(DEG)C less than the hottest jar (Black)
27818	10	1	white :: white because it doesnt absorb as much heat a s black
27819	10	2	light gray :: the color of the paint on the doghouse will a ffect it in many ways. to begin with, it will change the temperature of t he doghouse. if the doghouse were black, then it would absorb alot of the energy radiating from the sun. because darker colors hold heat more. the white would reflect alot of the heat of of the doghouse. making the temp erature cooler then if it were painted darker. the dark grey is going to keep it warm, but not as hot as the black paint would. and the light grey would keep it cooler, but not as cool as the white would. so it would al l depend on were you lived. and what temperature best suited your pet. th e darker colors are going to absorb more of the heat. and the lighter col ors are going to reflect more of it off. i would choose light grey for my doghouse though. because it would keep more of the heat off but it would also keep it warmer then just having it be white.
27820	10	2	dark gray :: If i were to paint a dog house the color i wo uld choose would be dark grey.Because black would absorb to much heat dur ing the hot days.And white would absorb no heat so during cold night the dog house would be very cold.And dark grey is just in the middle so it do es not get to hot or to cold.
27821	10	0	dark gray :: Dark gray is the best color to paint a doghou se with for many reasons. One reason is that in the results of their expe riment drak gray had the same temperature all 3 trial times and same aver age of 48(DEG)C this ment that dark gray is a good color for a doghouse because it will absorb the right amount of energy in order for the doghou se to maintain at the right temperature. Dark grayis not a too dark color but not a too light color either.
27822	10	2	black :: The color black will make the doghouse warmer . This is becuase in the experiment the average temperature for the Black Lid was 53(DEG) C compared to the White Lid at the average of 42(DEG) C. This shows that the darker the color the warmer the object/doghouse wi ll be because it obsorbs more heat.
27823	10	1	light gray :: I chose light gray because it is the perfect temperature. It's average temperature, 45(DEG) C, is a very good tempera ture; not too hot and not too cold. If you paint the doghouse taht clour, it will be warm, but only slightly. It would protect the dog from swelte ring heat; but keep it from freezing.
27824	10	2	light gray ::  If the doghouse were to be light gray, the air temperature wouldn't be too low, but not too high. The average temperature of light gray compared to the average of black is 8(DEG) while the difference between light gray and white is 3(DEG). This way, light gray would be perfect as an in-between.
27825	10	0	white :: the dog well be more comfitable in the dog ho use.
27826	10	2	light gray :: I chose light gray because it doesn't attract a whole lot of heat like if you were to us black but attracts more heat then white does. Inside the doghouse in the winter would be nice because it would attract some heat to be warm in the winter. In the summer it wou ld be warmer then winter because there would be more sun and attract heat but not as much as if the color of the doghouse was black. Another reaso n why I chose light was it had an average temp of 45(DEG)c warmer than w hites average temp of 42(DEG)c.
27827	10	2	white :: I think that white would be the best color be cause in the data they had the lowest temputure so it would be the coldes t for the dog.
27828	10	1	white ::  White is the best color to choose because it reflects the sun's rays better than any other color. and it wont make the inside get to hot
27829	10	1	white ::  White will not attract the light as much as a ny of the othe colors, therefore allowing the dog to stay cool.
27830	10	0	light gray ::  Coloring the doghouse light gray could keep t he temperature inside the doghouse at a cool average of 45(DEG)C, which is the average temperature inside the glass jar for the lid color vs. air temperature inside glass jar experiment.
27831	10	2	white ::  the best color would be white because the ins ide of the doghouse would be cooler because the color white atracts less heat energy then the other colors because the results show that white had lower temperatures than the other colors
27832	10	0	dark gray :: brandi and jerry should use dark gray because it would be a comfertable temperature for the dog at 48(DEG)c, wich the data says is it's average
27833	10	1	light gray ::  It wold keep it warmer in the winter and cool er in the summer. The medium shade color is a fantastic way to keep a pet warm!
27834	10	1	white ::  because it will stay the coolest and the dog wont like it in there if its cold
27835	10	1	white ::  so the dog house doesent heat up as fast in t he summer so the dog can stay in his house longer
27836	10	2	light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse because d arker colors absorb more light energy. So light grey would absorb some bu t not alot keeping the inside of the doghouse cool and not really hot (45 (DEG))
27837	10	0	light gray ::  it will be the right temp for a dog
27838	10	2	dark gray :: I would choose Dark Gray because it will not absorb as much light as black would, but it still is a dark color to abso rb some light. This would affect the inside temperature of the doghouse b ecause it won't be to cold nor to hot in the doghouse. Comparing my choic e to the expirement When they used Black as the lid color it gave the hot est inside air temperature. Dark gray was in 2cnd place with a temperatur e of 48(DEG) C, but I thought 45(DEG)C for the light gray would be to c old.
27839	10	2	white :: Painting the doghouse white would affect it b ecause in the summer, the doghouse would be cooler. In the experiment, th e white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG)C while the pthers were much higher.
27840	10	2	white :: I chose to paint the doghouse the color white based off of Brandi and Jerry's experiment results. In the experiment, w hen they tested the lid color black, the average temperature inside the j ar was 53(DEG)C. This was the highest temperature out of the colors and the temperature raised by 29(DEG). Meanwhile, the white lid had an avera ge temperature of 42(DEG)C, therefore having the lowest temperature aver age. This time, the temperature raised only 18(DEG) after ten minutes. C ompared to the black lid, the white lid raised to a temperature and had a change from the original temperature of 11(DEG) less. Ultimately, I cho se to paint the doghouse white to keep the temperature the coolest. White had the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)C and would keep any dog n ice and cool.
27841	10	1	dark gray :: i say dark gray because it keeps the doghouse warm enough so that if it's cold outside, and it doesn't get it too hot for a sunny day outside. it's a 50/50 type thing warm enough and not too cold.
27842	10	2	white :: Black: Average temperature was 53(DEG) Dark Gray: Average temperature was 48(DEG) Light Gray: Average temperature was 45(DEG) White: Average temperature was 42(DEG) Because of the cool temperatures, I would ch oose white as the doghouse color. With black, the doghouse would be prett y hot and uncomfortable for the dog.
27843	10	2	white :: White would be the best color to have for a d og house because it's temperature would keep the dog house the coolest. I n the experiment the white colored jar had an average of 42(DEG)C, so th at was the best choice and the worst choice was black. The black colored jar had an average of 53(DEG)C, so that was the worst choice becau se it could be to hot for the dog.
27844	10	1	white ::  it will keep it from being to hot in the summ er
27845	10	1	light gray :: It may affect the dog house because if its to o hot then the dog will get too hot and if its too cold the dog would fre eze so if its not too hot and not too cold the dog house will be good for the dog year around.
27846	10	0	dark gray :: This color will make the doghouse one tempera ture and not many different temperatures. In the experiment the dark gray lid stayed at 48(DEG)C.
27847	10	1	black :: If you would paint a doghouse you would want your dog to be warm, so painting the doghouse black would keep him or her warm.
27848	10	2	white :: The color might affect the doghouse because t he darker the color is the hotter it is inside and the lighter the color the cooler it is inside. For example when tested the blakc got 53(DEG)c, the dark gray got 48(DEG)c, the light gray got 45(DEG)c, and the white got 42(DEG)c. you see as the color increases from darkto light,the temp ature decreases.
27849	10	2	white ::  I would choose the color white for the color of the doghouse because, it will make the inside of the dog house cooler for the dog so that during hot summer days the dog can stay cool and not super hot. The reason why this would work is shown on the trial board. Wh ile there was a black lid on a jar the average temperature of inside of j ar after 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C When there was a white lid on the jar the average temperature of the jar was 42(DEG)C. That is a 11(DEG) difference between the two lids. SO if you want the doghouse to be colde r for the dog you'd want to get a white doghouse.
27850	10	2	black :: Black, because if black had the most heating average maybe it might have the most heating average for ther dog house.
27851	10	1	white :: it cant be black because black obsorbs light. which would increase the temp, and white reflects light so that is why w hite kept the doghouse cooler at an average.
27852	10	2	black :: If they were to use a black paint it would de finetely increase the dog houses air tempature. Accordinq to the data the color black had an average of 52(DEG)c. after ten minutes of the experi ment, unlike the other lighter colors which had lower average tempatures .
27853	10	2	white :: The data table shows that the white lid jar t ook in the least heat. The black lid jar took in an average of 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes under the lamp. The white lid jar only took in an averag e of 42(DEG)C. This is why the doghouse should be painted white to keep most of the heat out.
27854	10	2	dark gray ::  If the doghouse were dark gray, it might affe ct the inside temperature of the doghouse. Heat is attracted to darker ob jects, so it would be warmer, but not as warm as it would be black. The d ata from the experiment shows that the black lid on average was 53(DEG)C , the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the white was 42(DEG)C.
27855	10	0	black :: the color black could affect the temperature in the dog house because the color black can attract light and heat since the color black is an absence of light.
27856	10	2	white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white because then the inside of the doghouse would stay cool and comfortable for the dog to be inside it when it's sunny outside. I know this because in the investigation when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a black lid, the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, but when the lamp was heating a glass jar with a white lid , the air temperature inside the jar was an average of 42(DEG)C after 10 minutes. So, if the doghouse was painted white the temperature would be cooler.
27857	10	0	light gray :: it will affect the doghouse by it being coole r then heat temperature getting attracted to it.
27858	10	2	white :: White would keep the doghouse cooler in the s ummer because it reflects more light waves than it absorbs. In their test Brandi and Jerry found that white kept the jar the coolest
27859	10	2	white :: The white color paint will protect the doghou se from heat because it isn't as dark. From the experiment it shows that a darker object stores more energy causing it to heat up in air temperatu re.
27860	10	1	white ::  because the darker the lid color,the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar, because darker colors absorb more energy.
27861	10	1	dark gray :: It will keep the dog house inside warm in col d weather yet cool in hot weather.
27862	10	2	white ::  Having white would make the inside temp. cooler because in the experiment the jar with the white lid had the coolest average temperature of 42(DEG)C.
27863	10	1	light gray ::  light gray because when it is warm, the dog will want to stay cool and when the weather is cold the dog will want to stay warm. The results got higher and lower, for example, the first trial was 44 it increased by hte second trial.
27864	10	0	black :: black is a darker coler, if you were to were a white shirt apposed to a black one on a hot day you will be warmer in t he black shirt because it absorbs more energy.
27865	10	0	white ::  the color white because it wont attract as much energy or haet if it were darcker
27866	10	1	light gray :: This color might affect the dog house by maki ng it kind of cool and not so hot for the dog because it is not as dark a s black so it won't absorb a lot of energy but also it is not as light as white so it won't be too cold
27867	10	2	white :: it would affect the doghoused because white i s cooler than the dark colors. the average for white was 42 while the average for black was 53.
27868	10	1	white :: If the doghouse is somewhere warm, it should be white to keep it as cool as possible inside the doghouse.
27869	10	2	black :: The black paint would insulate the inside of the dog house and keep it warm. The color black reflects heat. In the exp eriment black had the highest average temperture of 53(DEG) over all the other tested colors.
27870	10	1	light gray :: T way this color might affect the inside of t he doghouse by not being to hot because the darker the lid color,the grea ter the increase in the air temperature amd because light gray is only 45 (DEG)C.
27871	10	1	white :: I would use white because it is the coolest color and it wont over heat the dog as bad unlike the other colors.
27872	10	1	black :: If Brandi and Jerry chose Black, it would kee p the dog house the warmest out of the four colors
27873	10	1	white :: it would keep the dog/ dog house the coolest on the inside. so it wouldnt get too hot. where if you painted it black i t would get much warmer in there.
27874	10	2	white ::  I would use white to paint my dog house because it would make it colder inside for the dog. In the experiment the white lens tested to stay the coldest inside the jar so the white paint on the dog house would make it so the dog house was colder for the dog.
27875	10	1	dark gray :: They might want to choose dark gray because i t will make the doghouse not too hot as black and not too cold as white f or it will still obsorb heat and make the doghouse warm like the jar temp eratures stayed the same at 48(DEG)C after heated. So the dog would stay more and obtain the same amount of temperature the whole time when heate d most likely and not have to change around to different temperatures.
27876	10	2	white :: it will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler in it. it showed it was 42(DEG) and thats cooler than a ll the other colors
27877	10	0	white ::  the dog needs warmth
27878	10	0	black :: it will effect the dog house is by the color of the paint and the temperoture. also it will effect it is because how dark is the paint.
27879	10	1	black :: If it were to be cold outside, the black on t he doghouse should make it warmer.
27880	10	1	black ::  The black would absorbe the most thermal energy causing the dog house to have a higher air tempature (get warmer).
27881	10	1	white :: white will make it so that the dog house will be cooler for the dog
27882	10	0	white :: The white color attracks less heat so that wa y the dog isn't to hot or to cold
27883	10	2	black ::  The color black will affect the inside of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air t emperature. In the results of the hot lamp experiment, the blacks air tem perature got the highest average with 53(DEG)C .This is because dark co lors absorb more energy.
27884	10	1	light gray :: light gray so the doghouse wont be so hot .
27885	10	1	black :: Well in cold temperatures like in the experiment you would want your dog to have a warm sleeping area so you would choose black in the winter because that color absorbs the most heat keeping the doghouse warm. If it was the summer time you might want to used white or light gray to keep the house cool.
27886	10	1	dark gray :: i would use dark grey because (based of were i live) its colder most of the year but its hot during summer so that way when the dog is inside during winter its warm and during summer its not too hot
27887	10	2	white :: White will keep the dog house cooler inside b ecause its the lightest (brightest) color up there and in the experiment it shows that the over all average of the black (darkest color) was 53 de grees C and the average color for the white lid was 42 degrees C. Therfor e making white the coldest color possible for the dog house.
27888	10	2	black :: By painting the doghouse black, Brandi and Jerry will be allowing more heat to be attracted to the doghouse. The data table from the experiment proves this point because it shows that the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes while using the black lid was 53(DEG) C, which is the highest average temperature of the four lid colors that were used in the experiment.
27889	10	1	black :: black might effect the dog house by keeping i t warmer because black attacts heat , it asorbs the heat .
27890	10	2	light gray :: This way the inside of the doghouse won't be too hot or too cold. The average temperature was 45(DEG). White would be too cold because the average temperature was 42(DEG). Black would be to o hot because the average temperature was 53(DEG).
27891	10	1	white :: it will make it not as warm
27892	10	1	white ::  beacuse white reflects the sun so it would st ay cooler
27893	10	1	white :: i chose white because its a very bright, chee rful and an elegant color and the dog won't get really hot like he would in black or dark gray.
27894	10	2	white :: I think that the best paint color for the dog house is White. I picked this color because white doesnt affect the insid e of the house with a lot of heat. So it would stay cool during the summe r time for a dog. Because if you paint it balck, sense black attracts the sun it would attract more energy and have more of the hott sun going in the dog house.
27895	10	2	light gray :: I chose Light Gray because if you put black i t might be too hot because the trials where the avergae was 53(DEG)c. F or dark gray it may also get to hot hot because the average was 48(DEG)c . Light gray was 45(DEG)c and that just perfect it wont be to cold or to hot. White may be to cold at 42(DEG)c.
27896	10	2	white :: White's (color of paint) affect on the doghou se will be that the doghouse will take longer to heat up. So in the summe r, the dog will be able to stay cooler, longer. I know this because in th e experiment, the white jar lid heated up the least of the four colors by atleast 2(DEG) C each trial.
27897	10	2	black ::  i chose black becuase that means the dog hous e would be warmer on the inside, i know that because the average temperat ure of black after ten minutes is 53 degrees while the average temperatur e of white after ten minutes is 42 degrees.
27898	10	2	white ::  Having a white doghouse would keep the inside mof the doghouse cooler. The average tempature for the inside of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG), while the inside of the jar with the bl ack lid was an average of 53(DEG). The dog house would be on average 11(DEG) cooler.
27899	10	1	light gray ::  Since the darker colors were to hot and the l ighter colors were to cold the light gray was kind of the middle so the d og wont be to cold or to hot
27900	10	1	white ::  You would choose white because instead of abs orbing the sun light like black paint the white paint reflects it which w ould make the dog house more cool.
27901	10	2	white :: The color that would be best for the doghouse in the SUMMER would be white. In the experiment with the effects of colo r on temperature, the black lid caused the greatest increase in temperatu re, rising from 24(DEG) C to an average of 53(DEG) C. But the white lid caused the least increase in temperature, rising from 24(DEG) C to only 42(DEG) C. So if Brandi and Jerry want to keep the inside of the doghou se cool in the summer, they should choose to paint the outside of the dog house white, as it provides the least increase in temperature.
27902	10	2	white :: A white dog house would make it cooler inside . From the data the average temperature for white was 42(DEG)C which was cooler then the other colors.
27903	10	2	white :: it will effect the dog house by absorbing les s heat energy keeping the dog house cool,evidence frome the table states the average temp. for white is 42 celsius.
27904	10	1	white :: I think they should paint the dog house white because when there is a dark color such as black it will absorbe the he at so its best to use white so it wont be as hot in the dog house.
27905	10	2	white :: The color white will reflect more of the sunl ight. Wich will make the house a colder temperature.White was the coldest temperature in the expirement.Its average was 42(DEG) wich was the lowe st temperature and black had the highest temperature wich was 53(DEG) as an average.
27906	10	1	white ::  well...if they were trying to make the doghou se nice and cool,they should use white.the color white reflects everythin g off of it making it a perfect doghouse to stay cool in.it blocks about 30% more heat than a black dog house.
27907	10	0	white ::  the white light will make the dog house have light in it.
27908	10	0	black :: i think black becuase it was the highest numb er on the average it was 53.
27909	10	2	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse li ght gray. Light gray will keep the doghouse not too warm but not too cold . In the experiment the light gray lid let in an average of 45(DEG)C. Th e black lid let in an average of 53(DEG)C. The least heat let in was the white lid with an average of 42(DEG)C. If i chose the white lid, the do g might be too cold inside his house. With black paint, the dog could be too hot inside his house.
27910	10	2	light gray :: The best color for a doghouse might be Light gray because it wouldnt be to cold and it wouldn't be to hot. In the data it shows that the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG) c and the others were 53, 48, and 42(DEG)c
27911	10	0	light gray :: i like that color so i chose that color.
27912	10	1	dark gray :: Dark grey because black is probably to hot an d white is probably to cold, but dark grey is right in the middle. It wil l keep the dog warm.
27913	10	2	light gray :: This color was the in between color, or middl e color. It was not the hottest nor coldest it had a pretty good balance, so for trial 1 it was 44(DEG)c for trial 2 it was 45(DEG)c, for 3 it w as 46(DEG)C and for trial 4 it was back to 45(DEG)C. This is the best c olor, since it will keep the dog warm, but not too warm and not to cold e ither.
27914	10	1	dark gray ::  I think the bes color would be dark gray because its not the darkest and the darkest color absorbes more heat. Its not the lightest so it wont be very cold.
27915	10	1	white :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because in Jerry and Brandi's experiment, white was proved to be t he coolest (in degrees) color. Versus black because the black lid attract ed MORE light.
27916	10	0	white :: reduced tempertures
27917	10	1	light gray ::  I chose the color light grey because with sun the temperature inside the dog house will be around 45(DEG) and t hat is not to hot and not to cold for the dog.
27918	10	2	white :: white is the best color for the dog house bec ause dark colors absorb more energy than light colors. With white paint i nside the dog house it's going to be cool and cold rather than with dark color paint inside the dog house it's going to be hot. In the experiment dark color lids attraked more heat and the air was hotter than with the light color lids thats why white color paint will be a better color for t he dog house so it stays cooler.
27919	10	1	white ::  it willbe cooler then the other colors for th e dog house
27920	10	1	light gray :: Light gray might keep the dog house warm in t he winter yet cool in the summer because in the expiriment light gray att rects heat ,but not alot of heat.
27921	10	1	white :: well since the color is light gray instead of dark gray or black, it wont absorb as much heat, making a cool place to stay on a hot summer day. If it was light gray it wouldent be so ba d etheir but white sounded like the best option. Thses facts are true because the experiment s hows that a black lid did absorb more heat, while the others not so much.
27922	10	1	dark gray :: A dark gray might make the inside of th e dog house hot. Because darker colors absorb more heat energy. That woul d keep the dog house warmer at night,So thats why I picked dark gray. I a lso pick it because it will not absorb to much energy.
27923	10	1	white :: white doghouse would be nice and cool in it
27924	10	1	white :: Because the color white reflects thelight and heat better, in order to keep the doghouse cool it should be painted whi te. This will make the doghouse cooler inside, especially during the summ er.
27925	10	1	light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey, because then, the lightness of the doghouse would keep the temp erature down, and then tint of darkness would keep it mildly warm.
27926	10	1	white :: it would reflect the heat and keep the inside cool
27927	10	1	white ::  the white color will make the doghouse cooler in the summer by reflecting the light
27928	10	0	dark gray :: I think that Brandi and Jerry should use the dark gray paint because that way the inside of the dog house is cool for the dog when its hot outside unlike the three other paint colors that will attract the sun and make it hot inside the dog house, and also the dog wont have troubles sleeping because the light wont really reflect into the dog house to bother the dog while trying to sleep.
27929	10	1	white :: White is the lightest color there fore it wil l attract the least amount of heat.
27930	10	1	white ::  white has more energy its cooler and black and all the other colors are darker then white. The darker colors are closer together so they do not let as much light in
27931	10	1	light gray :: The color ''light gray'' would be good for th e dog house, because when it is hot the doghouse wont be that hot inside. Other than blak nd drack gray.
27932	10	1	white :: If it is white then the dog house will stay c ooler and the dog wont over heat.
27933	10	1	light gray :: because they probably dont want it to be to hot or to cold so if they use dark gray then it would be perfect not to cold not to hot for the dog. the temp would have an average temp of 45(DEG) not to hot not to cold.
27934	10	1	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry choose dark gray for thei r dog house then the dog house would be a little bit cooler than a black dog house but won't be cold like a white dog house. Therefore the dog wou ld be comfortable being in a cool, but at the same time warm doghouse.
27935	10	0	white :: dog houses are to protect and SHADE the dog a nd white does not attract heat
27936	10	2	white ::  A white painted doghouse would make the inter nal temperture cooler because as the experiment has shown, the average in ternal air temperture of the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG), while the other lids caused average tempertures ranging from 45(DEG) - 53(DEG).
27937	10	2	black ::  Painting a doghouse black would help heat the house. From the experiment, black made the air temperature rise th e most.
27938	10	1	white :: The color white might affect the doghouse bec uase during summer months it will not absorb as much ehat energy as a bla ck doghouse would. although in the winter months you will want more of th at energy abosrb so it is suggested to repaint the doghouse during the wi nter months.
27939	10	0	white :: because white doesnt absorb heat because its not an dark color.
27940	10	1	light gray :: Light grey paint would keep the doghouse a mu tual temprature. With a light grey colored paint on the doghouse the hou se wouldnt be to hot on a sunny day like a darker color would make it. An d on a cold day the dog house wouldnt be to cold with a light grey paint.
27941	10	2	white :: This color will make the doghouse cooler so t he dog will be more comfortable in the hot sun. According to the experime nt the white-colored lid had the coolest of temperatures out of all the 4 lids. It was 42(DEG) in the white lid for trial one and 54(DEG) for th e black lid on trial one.
27942	10	1	black :: Choosing the color black will affect the dogh ouse because dark colors absorb more energy
27943	10	1	dark gray :: i would paint the dog house dark gray, this w ay the dog house is warm in the winter but not to hot in the summer.
27944	10	1	dark gray ::  The color Dark Gray would affect the tempature of the doghouse because, as the data shows, a darker color results in hotter tempatures. The data shows that the average temature was 53(DEG) C for black, which would be to hot for a dog house. The Dark Gray however, had a lower tempature of 48(DEG) C, which would be the correct tempature to keep a dog warm, but not hot.
27945	10	1	dark gray :: if it's a hot day the dog house won't get too hot and if it's a cold day the dog house wont get too cold. the average tempature for the jar with the dark gray lid under the lamp is 45(DEG) C
27946	10	2	white :: this color wouldnt make it as hot inside the dog house as painting it black because as it shows in this experiment darker colors get hot faster, the black heated up to 53(DEG) and the white only heated up to 42(DEG)
27947	10	2	light gray :: The color light gray might affect the doghous e by balancing out the temperature of the air outside or around the dogho use. This also might be the most comforatable temp for the dog. Since, in Brandi &amp; Jerri's investigation,after being placed under a lamp for 1 0 minutes,the air temperature inside of the light gray lid jar was 45 deg rees celcius. While the other colored lid jars temperatures in degrees ce lsius were: White-42, Dark Gray-48, &amp; Black-53.So, a light gray dogho use would be 8 degrees celsius cooler then a black doghouse,In which I wo uld assume to be a more comforatable temperature.
27948	10	2	light gray :: I think that light grey would be a good color for a doghouse because this color would make the doghouse not too hot an d not too cold. According to the lid experiment light grey had averaging tempertures of 44-46 compared to the black average of 52-54 and the white average of 41-43. The averages for the light grey lid are moderately coo l which would be a good choice for a dog so they don't overheat or freeze .
27949	10	1	white :: white would be the less warm when the sun or heat is shining directly at it than any other choice
27950	10	2	black :: brandi and jerry should paint the dog house b lack because the dog house will be warmer the the other colors cause blac k will absorb the sun most. accordding to the data if you paint the doghouse black it will be warmer then if you paint it white because blac k got an average of 53(DEG) and white got an average of 42(DEG). so the re for black will be best color if you want it to be warm inside.
27951	10	1	white :: The lighter the color, the less heat that col or will attract/absorb
27952	10	2	white :: White will keep the inside of the dog house c ooler. The average temperature for white was 42(DEG)C after 10 min utes which is 3 less degrees than the second coolest color, grey, at 45(DEG) C
27953	10	0	white ::  Because the others takes in the light more th an the white paint
27954	10	1	white :: White would have a lower temperature inside t he doghouse, Making it nice and cool for the dog.
27955	10	2	white ::  If you chose to paint the doghouse white than it would be cool inside for your dog to rest in/cool off on hot summer d ays. White would decrease the temperature of the dog house because in the Air- Temperature experiment, the color black (the darkest lid) had the h ighest avg. temperature inside of the glass jar which was 53 C. the lightest color of lid (white) had t he lowest avg. temperature inside of the glass jar and it was 42 C. The difference between the dark lid (black) and the light lid (white) wa s 11 C. So therefore the lighter the color in this case white, will attra ct the least amount of sun resulting in a low temperature.
27956	10	1	white :: If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse whit e, then the light would reflect off he dog house. If they ppainted it bla ck then the light would be absorbed and it would get very hot inside and (if temperature gets hot enough) possibly even burn or catch on fire.
27957	10	2	light gray :: The white may be best because it is the colle st color (tempurature) as shown in the chart and will make sure the dog does not get overheated while in the house.
27958	10	1	light gray :: light gray willl be the best color because it wil absorb some heat but also keep the dog from getting to hot in the su mmer.The temperture where around 45(DEG)c which is good for a dog
27959	10	1	white :: That color will absorb the least amount of li ght keeping the dog house cooler
27960	10	2	white :: White will keep your dog house cooler on the inside rather than using a dark color like black because that will attrac t more heat.
27961	10	2	dark gray ::  The color dark grey would be the best color to paint the dog house. The color dark grey will affect the inside of the dog house by making it warmer but not as hot as the black. I know this because the average of the black in the experiment is 53(DEG) C and the average temperature for dark grey is 48(DEG) C
27962	10	2	black :: black might effect the dog house because in t he chart black has the highest temperature of all colors
27963	10	2	white :: Using white paint for the doghouse will keep it cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the black lid had an average t emperature of 53(DEG)C and the jar with the white lid had an average tem perature of 42(DEG)C. The jar with the white lid was an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid.
27964	10	1	light gray :: Light grey would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer, but will also will absorb more light than white, so it will b e warmer in the winter.
27965	10	1	white :: White would be a good color to paint the dog house because in the trials white had the cooler temperature.
27966	10	1	dark gray :: I would choose light gray because it would keep the dog nice and cool during day and warm at night . also depends on where they live.
27967	10	1	black ::  Black would make the inside of the doghouse w arm because the darker colors abosorbs the heat from the sunlight. So if Brandi and Jerry used the color black for the lid of the glass jar then t he lid would absorb more of the heat from the bulb. If Brandi and Jerry u sed the color white for the lid then the lid wouldn't absorb much of the heat from the bulb.
27968	10	2	black :: It will keep the house warmer in the winter. The balck lid had a average temperature of 53(DEG)C and the Dark gray ha d the average of 48(DEG)C. The Light gray had an average of 45(DEG)C an d the white had an average of 42(DEG)C. Therefor, the black colored roof is the best.
27969	10	2	black ::  Black being the color of the doghouse might affect it by making it warmer (higher temperature) because it absorbs more light energy. In the results, the temperature was 53(DEG)C while with the white lid was only 42(DEG)C, showing that black resulted in the highest temperature (was the warmest).
27970	10	1	light gray ::  it would make it so it's not too hot, but not too cold either.
27971	10	0	dark gray :: The best paint for it will be the dark gray b ecause darker colors absorb more energy.
27972	10	1	white ::  White would change the temperature inside the doghouse because the lighter the color or the darker the color the coole r or hotter the air will be inside the doghouse. So if the doghouse was w hite the air temperature will be cooler than the black air temperature do ghouse. I know that dogs like cooler air better than hotter air
27973	10	1	light gray :: if it is black then it will get hotter insine un like gray it wont
27974	10	2	white :: If Brandi and Jerry were to paint the dog hou se white, it would keep it cooler. When they did the lid experment, the a verage for the darker lid was highest (53(DEG)C). If they were to paint the dog house a darker color it would become hotter quicker. The average for the white paint was 42(DEG) C so it proves that painting the dog hou se a lighter color will keep it cooler.
27975	10	1	dark gray :: I think dark gray is the best coler because i n the winter it will not be so cold because it will get some of the sun a nd heat up, and also in the summer it would not be so hot from the sun, s o the dog could always be in his/her dog house any time of year.
27976	10	2	black :: The black paint would keep the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors of paint. The average temperature o f the glass jar with the black lid was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. The jar with the blac k paint was 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid.
27977	10	0	black :: If they were to choose black for their paint color, they would find that the dog house would attract more heat because thats what darker colors do; attract heat.
27978	10	2	white ::  They should use the color white because the c olor white doesnt attract heat very well so therefore it would keep it co oler inside of the dog house, the results show that in all the trials whi te was in the low 40's, and all the other colors like light grey an d black were in the high 40's and low 50's. Therefore the dog house would be cooler with white paint.
27979	10	1	black ::  Using black with attract more sun and it woul d be hotter inside the doghouse and hot to touch so unless you like it wa rm I would light gray.
27980	10	2	white :: I think white because the inside will be cool er as shown in the experiment. The white lid's highest temperature in the experiment was 43(DEG) where as the blacks highest temperature was 54(DEG) , which proves the white is cooler.
27981	10	2	white :: I choose white ,this mite affect the dog hous e by making cooler in hot weather. I choose this because in the experimen t white had the coolest temperature
27982	10	2	white ::  If Brandi and Jerry pianted the dog house whi te, then in the sun light the dog house will stay to an average of about 40-45(DEG)C because the color white deflects the sun light away off of t he dog house.
27983	10	1	white :: It will stay cool and if it was black it woul d be to hot for the dog.
27984	10	2	black :: the darker the color the warmer the dog house is going to be beacuse dark colors obsorbe more light then other colors
27985	10	2	white ::  this color would be good for a dog because if the dog needs to cool off the white color attracks less heat. i know thi s because the average temperature for black was 53(DEG), for dark gray i t was 48(DEG), for light gray it was 45(DEG) and for white it was 42(DEG) therefore white attracks less heat
27986	10	1	dark gray :: I would chose Dark Gray because in the summer it would be nice and cool and in the winter it wouldnt freez. The avrege temp. is 48(DEG), though out all the trials.
27987	10	0	white :: because not absorb much energy this color.
27988	10	2	white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white because the affect on the doghouse is that the color white will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler then if Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse black. This is because black absorbs more energy, causing the inside of the doghouse to be warmer and white reflects (energy) light so it'l l keep the inside of the doghouse cooler. From the experiment, when a black lid was used, the tempature inside the glass jar was 48(DEG) C but wh en a white lid was used, the tempature inside the glass jar was 42(DEG) C. So as you can see the lighter the color of the lid, the cooler the tempature inside the glass jar will be and the darker the color of the lid, the warmer the tempature inside the glass jar will be.
27989	10	0	light gray :: because it had 5 more then dark gray
27990	10	1	light gray ::  I chose light gray, because the inside of the doghouse will not be too hot or too cold if light gray was chosen. I learned in Brandi and Jerry's expirament that the darker the color of the lid was, the warmer the air temperature inside the jar was (after 10 minutes). If the dog house was light gray, the dog will be comfortably warm.
27991	10	0	white :: it wil keep the sun from hitting him
27992	10	1	white ::  thay should choose white becuse it attracts l ess heat so the dog can stay cooler
27993	10	1	black :: It will ABSORB HEAT BECAUSE BLACKABSORBS HEAT
27994	10	2	white :: They should choose white because according to the data the white had the lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)c and i t was the lighest color. If they chose black the dog house would be too h ot. i know this because black has the highest temerature average(53(DEG) c).
27995	10	2	white :: Because hot and the black made the jar 53.25(DEG) (on average) while the white only made it 42(DEG) on average. Making white th e better choice.
27996	10	1	white :: it would absorbe less heat so the dog would b e cooler than with black paint.
27997	10	1	black :: The averagre air temp in the jar was 53(DEG)
27998	10	2	white :: The color white is the best paint color for t he doghouse because it will keep the inside of the doghouse cool. White a veraged at 42(DEG)C after 10minutes while black was 53(DEG)C, proving t hat the white color paint will keep the doghouse cooler.
27999	10	2	black :: Black would be the best color if Brandi and Jerry lived in a cold area because black obsorbs heat more than any other color. According to thier experiment the black lid had the highest temperature.
28000	10	2	black :: Black paint would keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm. Black was 11(DEG),8(DEG),and 5(DEG) more than the white,lig ht gray,and dark gray paints.
28001	10	0	black ::  The color black attrackeds more Thermal Energ y than the other colors.
28002	10	1	light gray :: i chose light gray because the doghouse would be a little warm and a little fresh therefore the dog wouldnt be as hot on a sunny day or as cold on a rainy day
28003	10	1	white :: This color will affect the dog house because it will keep it cool when it's hot outside instead of being really hot in side of the dog's house because it stays the coolest.
28004	10	1	light gray ::  so it wont be too cool or too hot
28005	10	1	light gray :: if you are gonna paint a doghouse paint it light gray because the results of the experement show that the darker the color the higher the tempature and you dont want it to hot but you want it a little warm so you would paint it light gray.
28006	10	1	white :: White will keep the doghouse cooler and your dog get overheated and sick.
28007	10	1	light gray :: The dog house would be cold but for the dog w hich would have fur it would be warm and refreshingly cold so it would no t freeze and it would not over heat.
28008	10	1	white ::  Black will make the doghouse warmer because b lack attracts the light.
28009	10	1	black ::  It would make the doghouse much warmer as see n in the jar experiment.
28010	10	1	white ::  it whould be cooler inside the doghouse
28011	10	1	dark gray :: The dark grey paint would keep the doghouse w arm when it's cold out, but not as hot as the black paint when it's warm out. The dark grey paint got the inside of a glass jar to 48(DEG)i n direct light in just ten minutes, so it should keep the doghouse at a reasonable temperature.
28012	10	0	white :: White reflects the suns rays
28013	10	2	white ::  Since dogs have fur, they dont need to be any warmer so they should paint the dog house a lighter color. the black color was 53(DEG)c and the white was 42(DEG)c making the white coloe le ss likely to become hot
28014	10	2	black :: in the data table it shows the black paint wi ll keep the doghouse the warmest because,black obsorbs more sunlight than dark gray, light gray or white paint
28015	10	1	black :: the color black will effect the dog house mor e because of the more energy it observes the tempeture goes higher
28016	10	1	white ::  the doghouse would be build to cool off the dog so if you paint the doghouse white then the doghouse would absorb less heat therefore keeping the dog cooled off.
28017	10	2	white :: white would be a good color for the dog house because a dog can get very hot during the summer so the inside of the do ghouse will stay cool. in the experiment the white colored lid had an ave rage temperature of 42(DEG)C when the black lid had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG) C. Also out of the 4 colores the air in the glass jar with the white lid was the coolest
28018	10	2	black :: black would obsorb the heat and keep the dog house warm in the experiment in trial one the temperature was 54(DEG)c c ompared to the color white wich was 42(DEG)c the temperature was a big j ump from black and white.
28019	10	2	white ::  It will keep the dog cooler because it was th e least warmest in the jar.
28020	10	1	white :: If they paint the dog house white, it would s tay cooler compaired to the black
28021	10	2	white :: having white paint would make the dog house c older so in the summer the dog would not be hot. The average for white is the coolest tempature (42(DEG))
28022	10	2	light gray ::  I think that light gray is a good color becau se when it's sunny and hot outside, the darker colors will make the dogho use very warm and most likely uncomfortable for the dog. I didn't choose white because although it's not a huge difference, light gray was still a little bit warmer than white without being too hot.
28023	10	2	light gray :: the inside wont be hot and it wont be very co ld either. the light gray average temperature had an average of 45(DEG)C unlike the black lid which got hotter and had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
28024	10	1	light gray :: I think that the best color to paint the dog house would be light gray because if you paint it black or dark gray then in the summer it will get too hot inside the dog house. But if you paint it white then it will get too cold in the dog house in the winter so I t hink that light gray is the perfect color to paint the dog house.
28025	10	2	black ::  based on the results in the experiment if the y painted the doghouse black it would keep the air temeture inside the do ghouse the highest wich would keep the dog the warmest.
28026	10	1	white ::  If the doghouse is white the doghouse will be cooler on the inside and therefore much more comfortable on the inside.
28027	10	1	dark gray :: The black color might affect the doghouse in a good way, because it will keep the doghouse warm when it is sunny outside. And the dog won't be cold it will be warm.
28028	10	2	white :: Brandi and jerry should paint the the doghous e the color white. This color will affect the inside of the dogh ouse because it will absorb less heat and make the inside of the doghouse cooler than if you use a dark color becaue light colors absorb less ener gy. Evidence from Brandi and Jerry's Hot lamp exp eriment showed that the darker the color of the lid, the warmer the air i nside the jar was. So if they plan to have a living animal insid e (in this case a dog) I think it'd be more comfortable if the doghouse w asn't hot, they should paint the dog house white.
28029	10	1	white :: White is the best choose for the dog house be cause it will stay cooler the the other color
28030	10	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse bl ack because in the data table they got results which showed for trial one they got 54(DEG), trial two 52(DEG), trial three 54(DEG), and the adv erage they got was 53(DEG). So they should paint the doghouse black beca use it will stay warmer inside because the sun is attracted to the color black.
28031	10	0	white ::  I think it wont affect the doghouse because i t is white and I dont think it well attract the sun as much as the black color well.
28032	10	2	white :: If you design a white doghouse the chances ar e that the doghouse would be more cooler then the black, dark gray,light gray doghouses because the darker the color the more energy it will absor b. See beacause when they did the experiment the black lid absorbed more energy then all the others because of it's drak color, and the white lid absorbed less energy then the others because it's lighter color.
28033	10	2	black ::  If Brandi and Jerry painted their dog house black it would absorb more energy from the sun and be warmer inside. I know this because in their experiment the jar with the black lid had the highest air temperature. The average temperature of the jar with the black lid was 53(DEG)C which is higher than the dark gray (48(DEG)C), the light gray (45(DEG)C), and the white (42(DEG)C)
28034	10	1	black :: The black paint would affect the doghouse, be cause it would absorb heat and insulate the doghouse, making it hot.
28035	10	2	light gray :: Brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse li ght gray because in the summer time it will keep the inside of the doghou se cooler then the black and dark grey but a little warmer then the white .
28036	10	2	black :: useing the black color for the dog house will make the dog house warmer because on the data of the lid color vs. Air tempature inside glass jar. the black lid made the jar 11 degrees warmer than the white jar at 42(DEG) s so therefore the doghouse will be warmer with the black paint.
28037	10	0	black :: black because in the experiment it shows that black keeps heat in more
28038	10	2	white :: The best paint color for the doghouse would b e white. In the experiment white had an average of 42(DEG)C wich wus the lowest temperature out of the four colors. White would keep the doghouse cool.
28039	10	1	light gray :: light grey so it disn't get too hot in the su mer and not too cold in the winter.
28040	10	2	black :: Black would probubly affect the doghouse because it would absorb more heat. Plus the experiment shows that black kept in the most heat.
28041	10	2	white :: white is the best color because in the expera ment the white colored lid was the least one to atrack heat and was the l owest in tempeture.
28042	10	2	white :: If they paint the doghouse white then the tem peratrure inside will be alot cooloer becuase the white lid was 11(DEG) cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore painting the doho use white would keep the dog nice and cool
28043	10	2	black :: it would affect the doghouse by always keeping it warm, because black has more pigment in it so it absorbs the light more. and in the investigation the average for black was 53, the highest out of the rest, so thats my prove that it would make it warmer/hot.
28044	10	1	white :: if you use white the tem in the dog house wou ld be less
28045	10	1	white :: the inside of the dog house wont be so hot be cause white paint wouldnt absorb alot of heat energy
28046	10	2	dark gray ::  The inside of the dog house would be moderatl y warm with dark gray at 48(DEG)c, Black would make it hot at 50(DEG)c, light gray would make it cool at 45(DEG)c, and white would keep it cold at 42(DEG)c.
28047	10	1	dark gray :: I believe that the doghouse should be dark gray because not only the temperature from the experiment, but also the suitable conditions for a dog. According to the data the average temperature is at 48(DEG)C while the color black is at 53(DEG)C. For a dog to live in a doghouse the temperature shouldn't be too hot or too cold.
28048	10	2	dark gray ::  If the color is dark grey for the doghouse th an it would keep the dog warmer during harsh weather yet not too warm for very warm seasons. In the investigation Hot Lamp, the lid color that inc reased the inside temperature the most was the black colored lid with an average temperature of 53(DEG) C, however the second highest was the dar k grey lid with an average of 48(DEG) C. So, the dark grey roof would be the perfect color for the house, to keep the dog at a comfortable temper ture.
28049	10	1	black :: Because , The darker the lid color , the grea ter the increase in the air temperature in the glass jar.
28050	10	1	dark gray :: The best paint color would be dark gray becau se it keeps heat inside the dog house because of the color and when its w arm out it wont be too hot to stay in for the dog.
28051	10	2	black ::  I believe that the best color for the doghous e is black. This color may affect the inside of the doghouse by increasin g its temprature, therefore, the dog can stay warm. I know this is true b ecause the average heat in the experiment for black was 53 degrees, while the average temprature with white, for example, was 42 degrees. Clearly, black would be the best color for the doghouse.
28052	10	1	white :: white would be a good color for the doghouse because the white will not absorb heat and the dog will have cool place t o go during the summer or hot days.
28053	10	1	light gray :: light gray because it is not that hot o r that cold and it has a okay average.
28054	10	2	white ::  White is the best choice because when they did the test with the lamp, the white lid was the coolest with an average t emperature of 42(DEG)c. The black lid was 53(DEG)c, the dark gray lid w as 48(DEG)c, and the light gray lid was 45(DEG)c. If they use black as the doghouse colour then the dog might get to hot if he/she stays in there to long. If they use dark gray for the dog house then he will have more time to get out of the dog house before heating up but he still can heat up. If they use light gray for the colour of the dog house then the dog will still have more time to get out of the dog house than if the used black or dark gray but he still has the chance of over heating. If they use white as the dog house colour then the dog will have the most amount of time to get out before he/she over heats.
28055	10	1	dark gray :: if they chose dark grey, the average temperat ure would be 48(DEG) which is normal so the dog house wouldnt be so hot for the dog, but cozy and not as cold either.
28056	10	0	light gray :: i would go with the light gray because gray k eeps heat in but not to much heat and gray lets the cold air out when its cold out side
28057	10	1	light gray :: u waant one that will keep u worm in the winter but cool in the summer
28058	10	1	white ::  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house w hite because than the dog can stay cooler in the summer time
28059	10	1	white ::  If they use white paint for the doghouse, the house won't be too hot for the dog, because during the experiment they found out that the darker the color, the more energy it absorbes.
28060	10	0	white :: The color is going to effect the dog house by makeing the house fresh because dark colors consume more tempeture.
28061	10	2	black :: the color might affect the dog house because the darker the color is the warmer the dog house would be. In the experim ent hot lamp, the darker the lid was the warmer the air got inside the ja r. when the lid was black the tempature was at 53(DEG)(C) and when the w hite lid was on the tempature decreased to 42(DEG)(C).
28062	10	2	white :: white because the white gets less heat than t he other colors. black got an average of 53(DEG)c. the dark gray got an average of 48(DEG)c. and light gray got an average of 45(DEG)c. but the white got an average of 42(DEG)c. so it should be white.
28063	10	1	white :: it white because white would keep the dog hou se coler than all the other coior
28064	10	0	dark gray :: The color might affect the inside of the dog house because the average temperature is 48(DEG)C , and in trial 1 ,2 ,a nd 3 the temperature was 48(DEG)C also .
28065	10	2	black :: A black dog house will hold heat better than anyother color.I know this because in the lid experiment black's air temp ature had the highest average out of dark grey light grey and white.
28066	10	1	black ::  black is the best at capturing and keeping he at. its average heat was 53
28067	10	1	black :: With a darker color during the winter the dog wouldn't be as cold. With black the average tempreture would be 53(DEG) C. The diffrence between White and Black was 12(DEG) C hotter in the black jar then the white jar.
28068	10	2	white :: White would effect the inside of the dog hous e because white clearly kept the air temperature inside of the glass jar in the experiment cooler than black, dark gray, or light gray. The averag e temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG)C while the avera ge for the black lid was 53(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG). Alt hough the dark gray lid and the light gray lid didn't have such an extrem e difference from the white lid, the dark and light gray lid still rose t he air temperature quite a lot from the starting temperature which was 24 (DEG)C. Also on average the black lid rose the air temperature in the gl ass container 29(DEG)C from the starting temperature while the white lid only rose the air temperature 18(DEG)C from the starting temperature on average. That is a difference of agian 11(DEG)C.
28069	10	1	white :: If Brandi and Jerry use white, the dog house wont be as hot, or higher temperature, because white attracts the LEAST a mount of heat.
28070	10	2	white :: I think that white would be the color because according to the experiment, white had the lowest temperature so the dog s wouldn't get to hot.
28071	10	0	black :: it will give it more air and light for the dog
28072	10	1	white ::  It might affect it because the darker the col or the hotter it is
28073	10	0	light gray :: I chose light gray because say its a really c old day outside, and your dog is inside his doghouse. Ill bet hes really happy that you didnt chose to paint it white instead.
28074	10	1	light gray ::  if you choose cark grey the inside of the dar k house wont be to warm or to cold. when you used black it had an average of 53 degrees because the darkness is absorbing all of the heat. the whi te on the other hand is 42 degrees adn isnt absorbing as much of the warm ness. you would nt want the doghouse to be to warm or to hot so if you ch ose light the dog could have a perfect tempeture , becasue he already has a thick fur line keeping him warm and we would want him to become so war m and become faint. so light gray wch collects 42 degrees on an avergae i s better
28075	10	1	white :: I chose white because the color white does not absorb as much heat as black so the white would keep the dog cooled when it is hot.
28076	10	0	light gray ::  they liked it becuse they like dog house's
28077	10	1	black ::  if brandi and jerry increased the darker the doghouse(black) then the doghouse will be a lot hotter because the darker the dog house the more energy is absorbed.
28078	10	2	white ::  Based on the data white will make the dog house cooler. Light colors don't absorb as much heat as dark colors. In conclusion white would be the best color for the hot weather.
28079	10	2	black :: Acorrding the expirement, the black lid on th e jar caused the temperature inside the jar to be higher, therefore makin g a black-painted doghouse have warmer temperatures than other colors.
28080	10	2	light gray ::  Light gray is the best color for a doghouse b ecause a black dog house is too hot for the dog, being 53(DEG)C on avera ge. The white doghouse would be too cold from only having 42(DEG)C insid e. The only options left are dark gray and light gray, but with the heat coming off from the dog itself, more heat will circulate around the doghouse. Therefore, light gray, with 45(DEG) C on average, would be a better color to paint a doghouse than dark gray, with 48(DEG)C on average.
28081	10	1	white ::  If it is white then the air in the dog house will stay cool on hot days.
28082	10	2	white :: they should use white because the average tem perature of white was 42(DEG)C, and the average temp of black was 53(DEG) C. Therefore, the color white would keep the dog coolest.
28083	10	2	dark gray ::  A dark gray dog house would keep the doghouse warm but not too hot in the sun. In the experiment the jar with the dark gray lid didn't have the hottest or the coldest air inside.
28084	10	0	white ::  le color se be mas bonito que los otros.
28085	10	1	white :: The color white will keep away the heat on ho t summer days keeping the doghouse cool.
28086	10	1	"dark gray :: The color dark gray will affect the doghouse by making the doghouse warm. Not too hot in the summer and not too cold i n the winter. The data table on ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Insid e Glass Jar"" says that the average temperature for dark gray lid is 48(DEG)C. This shows that it is a good temperature for most weather."
28087	10	1	white ::  this will make the doghouse the coolest becas ue it's average data was only 42 degrees C. This will keep the dog the co olest during the summer time
28088	10	0	black :: The color of the doghouse being black will be st maintain heat during cold seasons or periods of time. During the hotte r seasons, the dog occupying the house will have no need of the doghouse. Thus, overheating is not an issue.
28089	10	0	black ::  black is not a good color bacause it exstract s heat from the sun and and the trials for black are 54 52 54 53 and that s why they should not choose the color black.
28090	10	2	white :: White will keep the inside of the dog house colder during the summer or when its hot outside. The average for white is 42(DEG) instead of black being 53(DEG).
28091	10	0	white :: because, it will keep you more warmer.
28092	10	1	white :: white would make the dog house colder
28093	10	1	white :: the color white would be the best for the dog house because white absorbs the least energy and would keep the doghouse cool and comfortable
28094	10	1	light gray ::  the light gray color will keep a maintained normal temperature
28095	10	1	white :: I would paint it white so on a hot summer day Brandi and Jerry's dog could cool down.
28096	10	1	black :: This color will affects the doghouse internal temperature. The darkness of the color will absorb heat energy and keep the inside of this dog house warm.
28097	10	0	black ::  becues is black
28098	10	2	white ::  the white paint would make the doghouse coole r.the black paint would make the doghouse warmer at 53 degrees celicus. t he white paint would be 42degrees celcius.
28099	10	1	white ::  it will make the dog house cool for the dog o n hot days.
28100	10	1	black :: beacuse it can be warm inside the dog house i f the sun hits the black paint it can be hot in there and change the temp ature
28101	10	0	black ::  el negro por que el negro consume el calor y el blanco no
28102	10	1	white :: White would be the best color because the tem perature in the inside of the dog house would be colder than any other co lor
28103	10	2	white :: The dog house should be painted white because it would make the dog house the coolest (coldest). Since dogs like the s hade and cold to cool them down in the summer, white would reflect the mo st light energy and prevent it from becoming too hot. After ten min utes, the jar with the black lid heated up by 29 degrees C on average. Ho wever, the jar with the white lid didn't heat up at all on average.
28104	10	1	black :: Having a black doghouse will b warmer.
28105	10	1	white ::  white is the best color because it keeps it v ery cool, lighter colores like white reflex the sun lite that makes it mo re cool and darker coolors like black absord that makes it more hot
28106	10	1	light gray :: i picked light gray becuase i thought i didnt want the dog to be to hot in there by having it black or dark gray but t hen again i didnt want the dig to have white just in case he wont get to cold so i picked light gray so he/she will feel just right
28107	10	2	white :: I would choose White colored paint because the dog house would be cooler according to the results in the expiriment where black was for the first trial , 54(DEG)C, then for the last trial also 54(DEG)C. Where as White at its first trial got 42(DEG)C and 41(DEG)C for its last trial
28108	10	2	light gray ::  Since the doghouse will have a living being in it, the temperature should be comfortable for the dog. 53(DEG) C is very, very warm and would make a dog uncomfortable, especially on a warm su mmer day. But, 41(DEG) C is too cold for a dog in the winter time, as this would be a year-round house for the dog. So, 45(DEG) C would be less hot in the summer, and more warm in the winter, which is just perfect for the dog.
28109	10	1	white :: it wont exorb that much heat so it will cool insiode the dog house
28110	10	2	white :: White will keep the doghouse at a cooler temp erature than any of the other colors will, thus preventing the dog from o ver heating. This is proven by the fact that after ten minutes, a jar wit h a white lid had an increased temperature of 18(DEG)C, while jars with darker lids (ranging from light gray to black) had an increase in tempera ture of anywhere from 21(DEG)C to 29(DEG)C. The white lid kept the jar cooler, so it will keep the doghouse cooler as well. This is healthier fo r the dog.
28111	10	1	black ::  the color black would effect the air tempature of the dog house because in the scenario it says darker colors absorbe more energy.
28112	10	0	black ::  If you painted the outside of a dog-house, th en the inside would be warmer. No matter what color you painted the insid e.
28113	10	0	white :: white would be the best color to chose for th e doghouse, because white reflects off the sun. It doesnt absorb it like black, dark grey, or grey.
28114	10	1	dark gray :: The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because its close to median of the data. Also, the average temperature for dark gray is 48(DEG)C, this shows that the color can a bsorb and reflect light, so in cold days the doghouse will stay warm and on hot days the temperature inside the doghouse will be cooler.
28115	10	0	dark gray :: it will keep the temperature the same at all times
28116	10	2	white ::  The white paint would help keep the dog house cooler when it is hot out. From the experiment, the white lid was the co olest out of all four lids.
28117	10	1	white ::  White will keep the doghouse cool becuase it reflects light instead of absorbing it
28118	10	2	white :: White will make the dog house cooler on the inside unlike black. White had a average of 42(DEG)c and black was 53(DEG) c.
28119	10	2	light gray :: Light Gray was the color I would have chosen for the inside of the doghouse because, since black absorbs the most ener gy and the inside would have been hot. Dark Gray would have done the same thing as Black but just not as much energy would have been absorbed. Lig ht Gray would have been a perfect color, not only absorbing the perfect a mount of the light the inside would not have been as hot as the colors B lack and Dark Grey.
28120	10	2	light gray ::  As shown in experiment that Brandi and Jerry conducted, we learned that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs. Knowing this, we wouldn't want the dog to get overheated, so we would panint the dog house the lightest color available. Which in this case, is white. Though, the dog, being a live creature shouldn't get too cold, therefore, light gray is the perfect compromise. Keeping the dog wa rm enough, but not too hot.
28121	10	1	black :: This color black, could affect the doghouse b ecause the dog could get very hot in the Summer time. Also, the doghouse might get extremely hot from the sun and start to erode.
28122	10	1	dark gray :: i chose dark gray because it stayed the same heat every trial so it wouldnt be to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter
28123	10	2	white :: Durring the experiment, Brandi and Jerry foun d out that white was the color that least affected the air temperature in the jar when a lamp was directed toward it. If the white color was paint ed apon the top of the dog house, then the temperature wouldnt rise as mu ch as the black coored paint because, jerry and Brandi made there experim ent and got the results of white having the least affected air temperatur e when a lamp is directed at the jar. For example, on Trial 1, the white container had an air temperature of 42(DEG)C versis the air temperature in the black jar of 54(DEG)c.
28124	10	1	light gray ::  its cool but it gets some heat for the dog

28126	10	1	light gray ::  light gray could affect the inside of the dog house cause the color is not to dark so that it wont be to hot and its n ot to light so it wont be to cold the temperature will be just fine.
28127	10	2	white :: it will keep the doghouse cooler than any of the other colors becuase it stayed in a termperature of low 40(DEG)C. li ght gray was in high mid 40(DEG)C, dark gray in high 40(DEG)C, and blac k was in low 50(DEG)C proving that lighter colors keep the air temperatu re cooler
28128	10	2	light gray :: I picked dark gray because in the experiment it resulted having darker colors absorbs some heat. So that means lighter colors help reflect. Light gray helps absorb heat in the winter just a l ittle, and in the some helps reflect a good amount.
28129	10	2	black ::  they should make the dog house black so that it will keep the dog warmer in the winter becuase more heat will be absorbed. The black lid was an average of 5(DEG) warmer then the second warmest color so the dog will stay nice and warm inside the dog house
28130	10	1	light gray :: The tempature of the dog house would be from 44(DEG)C to 46(DEG)C. The dog house will be at a neutral condition beca use it will not be too hot or too cold
28131	10	1	light gray :: I choose dark gray because the light grey is perfect.say that its a could wet day.the dog is really could. the dog cou ld go into the dog house and stay warm with out being over welmed with he at from his body and fur. the color's averge tempurture was 48 degrees ce lceas.it keeps most of the temp in but leaving some out. also it gragulla y was getting warm at a slow pace.wich would help the dog alot when it ge ts to summer time so he dosnt get over heated,buy the suns heat
