6	1	1	I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
18	1	0	The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.
19	1	0	In order to replicate this experiment I would need a scare in order to get the mass. Next, I would need tape and markers to label the containers. Last, I would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment.

41	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
47	1	2	"One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words ""A sample"" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."
51	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
73	1	0	What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
97	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
125	1	0	It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
130	1	3	We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials

138	1	3	After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
141	1	2	Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use.
154	1	0	To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
172	1	2	After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments.
173	1	1	The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
176	1	2	To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
178	1	1	I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
179	1	2	The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
188	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
206	1	3	"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
211	1	3	The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
212	1	0	Tools.
216	1	2	One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
217	1	1	The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
221	1	2	The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to replicate the procedure.
226	1	1	In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
242	1	2	I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. What four types of materials we need for the experiment, to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment.
267	1	1	After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
276	1	1	The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
278	1	1	Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data.
286	1	2	They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers.
293	1	1	To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
316	1	1	Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
318	1	1	"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
319	1	2	The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
322	1	3	The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
330	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the containers? How much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment.
349	1	2	Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
353	1	0	To replicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
355	1	2	In order to replicate this expiriment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need.
376	1	0	After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
378	1	2	The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
380	1	1	Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
397	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
408	1	0	Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
413	1	0	Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
424	1	3	You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
426	1	0	It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
435	1	0	They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
436	1	0	The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
437	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the containers are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable.
450	1	1	After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
452	1	1	You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
453	1	0	In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass.
456	1	0	Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
463	1	1	To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
469	1	3	Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
488	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour.
504	1	2	Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
509	1	2	The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers, how much vinegar is put in each of the containers, and how much of the sample is in each container. In the procedure, they don't say what was in each of the containers. They also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the containers. Lastly, they didn't say how much of the sample was in the containers. They needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment.
513	1	2	To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.
517	1	1	Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
519	1	3	More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
522	1	1	I would need to know what the samples were.
528	1	2	One extra piece of information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used.
542	1	3	Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
550	1	1	I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
551	1	2	To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
555	1	3	I would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
556	1	2	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material).
568	1	2	Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
573	1	2	To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
580	1	0	This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
585	1	2	The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
587	1	3	In order to replicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
593	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
598	1	0	You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
602	1	2	In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
604	1	2	You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not.
612	1	2	1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of containers are being used.
615	1	2	"I would include the materials used or the ""samples"". Also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing, masing, and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup."
628	1	2	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
635	1	1	You would need to know the conditions of the sample: ^p -You would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics. ^p -You would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p -You would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar.
648	1	3	If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
656	1	3	I would need to know what the samples were of, how much vinegar, what containers, what material & how much of that material.
658	1	2	To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples. I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers. And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.
660	1	0	After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
662	1	2	The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
663	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal, because there are many diffrent
669	1	0	My first piece of information would be a bar graph then I would give specific directions on what I did. But I would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. Then I would write a conclusion why this prblly happened.
695	1	0	After reading the groups procedure, additional information Ii would need in order to replicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
697	1	2	To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
703	1	1	The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
706	1	3	I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
710	1	3	You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
722	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also wt kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass.
725	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
735	1	0	In order needs say the information.
736	1	1	Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
742	1	0	For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
768	1	1	In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
772	1	0	The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
785	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
790	1	2	Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used.
792	1	0	After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
798	1	1	Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
805	1	3	After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
809	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
818	1	3	"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
820	1	3	A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults.
841	1	1	After reading the group procedure the additional information, the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
849	1	1	To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
866	1	2	First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds.
869	1	1	There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
874	1	3	In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when replicated the same samples will be used.
876	1	1	How much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
877	1	0	What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
883	1	2	I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
891	1	1	In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
900	1	0	The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
902	1	1	Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using.
908	1	0	You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
917	1	0	Make sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
923	1	2	Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
930	1	1	After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure.
937	1	1	Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
945	1	0	In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
948	1	2	After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
949	1	3	In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
951	1	1	I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
953	1	0	You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
973	1	3	In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
978	1	0	This experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio.
989	1	1	To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
994	1	1	How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
1002	1	2	After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
1007	1	3	We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
1033	1	0	First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
1044	1	1	The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers.
1047	1	1	After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
1048	1	2	If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
1049	1	3	Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
1059	1	1	If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
1061	1	2	First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.
1071	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
1087	1	0	needed to replicate this experiment
1093	1	0	Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
1097	1	1	In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
1100	1	2	Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
1107	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks.
1114	1	2	The three thing's that I think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in, how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things.
1124	1	0	The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
1125	1	2	The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container. I need to kind the control group indipendant variable,dependant variable, control variable. Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers.
1135	1	3	There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
1144	1	0	"Place a sample of one material into one container and label, ""repeat with remaining samples"",meaning a sample into a sangle container."
1146	1	3	You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
1174	1	2	The changes they could make are ^p 1)Have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container. ^p 2)They should repete the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)And they should make sure they have the same size of each material.
1178	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
1179	1	0	-Change the amount of havre. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers.
1183	1	1	The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
1187	1	0	In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
1188	1	0	After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. What about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. How about the containers? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grams.
1196	1	1	After reading the group's procedure, you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis, the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results.
1197	1	3	It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
1213	1	0	What was the mass after 30 minutes. ^p What was the mass after 24 hours. ^p What was the influence between each time.
1217	1	0	The mass,use different mass. Different type of materials and different containers,
1220	1	1	I want to know if the containers are the same size. Also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate.
1231	1	2	To recreate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers. You would need to know what the samples are, how much of each are you would need. ^p  A.K.A :-Amount of vinegar ^p            -What kind of material the samples are made of ^p            -How much of each sample you'll add
1235	1	2	To replicate the experiment, you need to determine how much vinegar was used in each cup for this experiment. You also need to determine the tempature the did the experiment take place and how much of the material was used.
1247	1	3	I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container, I would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours. I would also need to know how I would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample, and I also need to know how many times I would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar.
1249	1	1	They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
1251	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know which types of samples to begin with (marble,limestone,wood,plastic). You would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2, and lastly, what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in?
1274	1	2	Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material. Also, good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials.
1286	1	0	Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
1289	1	3	To replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To replicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in.
1299	1	1	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
1321	1	2	One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
1323	1	3	In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
1327	1	1	To replicate the experiment, I'd need to know how much Vineger to pour into each sample. I'd also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup.
1345	1	1	To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.
1350	1	1	To replicate the group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the containers.
1367	1	3	First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
1375	1	3	One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
1379	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
1385	1	2	Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
1388	1	0	You will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it.
1390	1	0	I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
1395	1	1	What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
1405	1	3	I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
1431	1	2	To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
1433	1	3	In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
1441	1	0	To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
1442	1	3	Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
1450	1	0	To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
1456	1	2	Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a tripple beam before to measure.
1459	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers. I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours.
1463	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
1464	1	0	Tell us to do it again.
1465	1	2	One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
1482	1	0	In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
1487	1	1	They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
1494	1	0	First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
1495	1	0	It didn't give enough information.
1496	1	2	In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1498	1	3	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
1509	1	2	There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table.
1516	1	1	You would need the names of the samples you were using.
1522	1	2	In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
1534	1	3	Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
1538	1	0	You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
1554	1	1	In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
1558	1	3	One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
1559	1	1	In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
1563	1	2	Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
1571	1	2	"Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar."
1588	1	0	I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
1589	1	1	In order to replicate this expirement they would have to
1597	1	0	What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
1602	1	2	One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the containers looked like, so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change.
1606	1	0	After reading the group's procedure I would need to know what kind of samples was I supposed to got and how much I need to use for this investigation so I can replicate the experiment.
1618	1	2	In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1640	1	2	You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
1642	1	1	I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
1645	1	1	The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
1658	1	3	To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
1659	1	3	The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
1668	1	3	The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
1670	1	0	To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample.
2788	2	1	Changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data. ^P Give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment. Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.
2793	2	2	My conclusion to this experiment is that plastic sample B streched the most because it was probly a sample streches easily.^p B) Two things that could be changed is saying what kind of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on each clamp.
2797	2	3	a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
2799	2	1	A) Based on the student's data, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the most duriable because it stretched the least (an average of 11mm), while plastic type D is the least duriable. ^P B) To improve this experiment, the student's could have added a control and specified how much weight should be added to the clamp.
2802	2	1	Based on the students data, it looks like all 4 types of plastic stretched at least 10mm. The most amount stretched was 22mm for plastic type B then 20mm for D, 14 mm for c and 10mm for A. ^p To make the experiment more valid the student could perform more trials maybe using a different type of clamp or other weights to  test the plastic's flexibility.
2805	2	0	A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
2809	2	0	The second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail. One number lower than the first time and the number the same, one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results.
2810	2	1	The question in this experiment is how many weights did it take take for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The conclusion was that T2 was more of a success. One way the student could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp. Another way they could've improved was using the exact type of plastic with the same measurements.
2817	2	3	A: Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm. C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between. ^p B. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
2822	2	2	a) Plastic type B is more stretchable than plastic type A,C,or D because in trial 1 plastic B stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest. a) The student could improve the experimental design by being specific with what 4 polymers she was using, the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials than just 2.
2831	2	1	The conclusion that I draw based on the student's data is that plastic A streched the most. Two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes. Testing all materials three times improves the student validity, because it becomes more accurate. Allowing wieghts to hang longer make it easier to see which material streches the most.
2832	2	1	a) After review of the results one can conclude that plastic type B as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest mm stretch  distance for both trials.^p b) the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. By giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time.
2838	2	2	A. The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm. Also the plastic type D is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials. ^p B. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also they could've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial.
2843	2	0	a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
2849	2	3	a. Based on the student's result, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average. ^p b. 1. The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. 2. The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results.
2866	2	2	They could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times.
2869	2	0	The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, Add, subtracting, multiply, divide or something.
2886	2	1	a. My conclusion would be that the plastic type B would be better because it stretched more. ^p b. One way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags, with the weights the whole time ( control) types of plastic bags.
2895	2	1	The conclusion is that in trials the student conducted it seems that in T2, the plastic stretched more than trial one. The student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp. She could have taken away the second trial.
2901	2	2	a) Based on the data, you can conclude that polymer B had the most stretchability because it stretched the most trial one (22mm) and trial two (23mm). ^p b) To incate the validity of the experiment, the student could have include the amount of weight that was added to the clamp. This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant. The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added.
2915	2	0	a) The plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 mm ^p b) The student could have used more weights on the second trial, or maybe on the second trial let it beng longer.
2924	2	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A is the most durable.^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clearify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before he/she stretched it.
2934	2	2	Based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type B has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics. One way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test. Adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests.
2937	2	2	"A) A conclusion that I have concluded from the data table is: plastic type ""B and D"" were stretched the most leaving type ""A and C"" being the most durable types of plastic.^p B) Two ways that the students could have improved there experiment design/ or validity are: more trials for more accuracy. And more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most durable."
2948	2	3	I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the  experiment design and / or validity of the results is to make sure all the plastic types start out at the same length. Another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials.
2952	2	2	Plastic type B stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic. When i get low to the ground. How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic.
2956	2	1	"Plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2."
2966	2	3	A) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it's greatest length was 23mm. ^p B) They should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched. They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results.
2967	2	3	a. Based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type A has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment. One way that the experimental design could have been improved, is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal. Another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic.
2981	2	3	The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights.
2989	2	3	Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
2994	2	1	a). Plastic D and plastic C are not that good. The two types that increased type A and B. ^p b). They should'nt have taped it to a table. There should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also I think they should have measured in inches.
3009	2	2	A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight.^p B) The students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial. Also there should have been more than two trials.
3016	2	1	Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
3028	2	1	Based on the data  shown, plastic type 'D' seems to be the most durable. The table shows that it did not stretch. The student could have improved validity by doing more trials, and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test.
3041	2	0	Plastic type (A) stretched (2in) and plastic type (D) it didn't stretched at all.
3042	2	0	The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
3048	2	3	a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
3051	2	2	The plastic type B has the most elasticity over all the other plastics. Plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. A way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.
3054	2	3	A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
3067	2	1	I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
3080	2	2	A conclusion to data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types. The student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer.
3085	2	2	It can be concluded that plastic A is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic C would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.Followed by plastic D with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic B with 2205mm stretched .The student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length.
3104	2	2	A conclusion based on the data given is that each piece of plastic stretched around the same amount each trial. This lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same amount or weight for each trial.
3106	2	3	a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
3123	2	2	I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant. He could have added more that's. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate.
3127	2	2	a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
3133	2	1	(a) In this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic type A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Plastic type B was stretched 1mm. Lastly plastic type D was stretched 0mm. In conclusion plastic type A was the easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic.
3138	2	1	(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
3153	2	2	Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact.
3161	2	0	My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
3164	2	3	The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table.
3166	2	1	Based on the data table I would say that plastic D was your strongest plastic, because it didn't stretch. One way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic D. Another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights.
3171	2	3	Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
3177	2	3	Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
3201	2	2	a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used.
3203	2	3	"A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say ""weights"" by adding how heavy the weights are."
3209	2	1	3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
3216	2	1	Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
3220	2	0	The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
3232	2	2	Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
3240	2	0	To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment.
3254	2	1	A) The student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate.^p B) The student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference.
3261	2	1	Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
3266	2	3	a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
3272	2	2	a) Plastic type B stretched more than any of the other types of plastic in both of its trials. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experimental results would be to have a third trial of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results. Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials.
3279	2	2	One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
3289	2	2	In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
3291	2	1	A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
3294	2	1	A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
3296	2	2	In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment.
3304	2	3	Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
3315	2	1	The conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment. Some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also, the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time.
3322	2	1	a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
3326	2	2	"According to the data shown plastic type B was the strongest and plastic type A was the least strongest. The groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic "" if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better."
3328	2	2	a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm. b) The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
3334	2	3	Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
3336	2	2	Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C. The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
3347	2	3	a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
3349	2	2	Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
3352	2	3	The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
3372	2	1	The plastic that streched the most would be plastic type A because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. The students could've tested more plastics, or use a different method to strech the plastic.
3376	2	1	a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
3378	2	2	(A) Based on the data, plastic material A was the most durable out of the four tested. This is because plastic A only stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12 on the second, while plastic B stretched 22 & 23mm, plastic C 14 and 13, and plastic D 20 each time. This means that plastic A tolerated the weight on the clamp the best, and also that plastic B tolerated it the least. ^p (B) The students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data, and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible.
3381	2	1	My conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it. The student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp, also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure.
3386	2	1	A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
3389	2	0	The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
3390	2	0	I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
3394	2	1	The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
3395	2	3	Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
3402	2	3	a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
3414	2	3	In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
3418	2	3	Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
3426	2	0	A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
3428	2	3	Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
3431	2	1	Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
3432	2	1	a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
3443	2	2	a. Plastic type A was the most streachable of all plastics tested.^b.One way the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is if they repeated the test on each plastic several times to ensure their results were correct. Another way that they could improve the design is if they specified amount of weight added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight.
3446	2	0	a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
3447	2	3	A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
3454	2	1	A. From looking at the data plastic type B in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them. ^p B. The students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each. They also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps.
3456	2	3	Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
3457	2	1	I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
3459	2	0	"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
3466	2	1	A conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type D appears to be the most reliable, or stretchs the most. Two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first. and which held out the longest  could have been the strongest.
3468	2	1	a) Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2, the least stretchable plastic was plastic type A. Type C was not very stretchable, and plastic D was the second most flexible. ^p To ensure accuracy of the experiment. ^p The student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table, to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time.
3476	2	0	In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
3477	2	2	According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were. By stating the length and type of each plastic . The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic. Another thing, the student should have done is stated how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it was the same each time.
3483	2	3	A) A conclusion I could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type B has stretched 22-23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials. While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given. They also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end.
3518	2	2	Out of both trials plastic type B got the longest after experiment. It streched out to 22mm in trial A and 23mm in trial B. Plastic type A stretched out the least. In trial A it reached 10mm and in trial B it reached to 12mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table. They could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters.
3525	2	2	A It is concluded that plastic type A had the most streachability because it increased 2mm in length from being streched, and all the others either grew smaller or barely streched. ^p B Two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples.
3526	2	2	A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
3541	2	2	Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B. This student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch. He could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
3547	2	2	"Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""B"" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest."
3549	2	1	Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
3551	2	1	The conclusion is that the plastic B is the largest one in trial 1 & in trial 2. 30 plastic B is  the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style. the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer time.
3553	2	1	a.) The conclusion is that plastic type B had the most amount stretched in both trails and plastic type A had the least amount stretched in both trails. ^p b.) One way the students could have improved their experiment would have to be: Tell what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell how long they stretched each plastic.
3562	2	2	It would appear from the data that plastic type B is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics. It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics. One way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g, 50g, 100g. Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
3566	2	1	Based on the student's data, I concluded that the amount each plastic stretch, had varied very little between trials. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiments would be, 1. They could have recorded the plastic samples lengths before they stretched them. 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length, the started them.
3588	2	1	(A) In contend the data recorded shows that plastic type D stretched the same amount in each trial. ^p (B) The students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time.
3601	2	1	(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
3607	2	1	plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not.
3609	2	2	a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer.
3612	2	0	(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
3614	2	1	Student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done. The whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. ^p They could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear.
3621	2	3	"Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."
3622	2	3	a.Based on the students data plastic B was able to be stretched the most, it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)First, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed. To get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point.
3624	2	3	a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3628	2	3	Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
3631	2	2	Based on the students data plastic A and B both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic B. ^p The student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
3645	2	2	(a) Based on the students trials I have come to conclusion that plastic B was able to stretch more than A, C, D witch make it more resistant then the rest.^p (B)The students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it could change, and they could of also made a graph to show the results.
3658	2	1	a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
3659	2	3	A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
3677	2	0	The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
3678	2	2	A) That depending on the plastic type depends weather the plastic stretch or not and how much. ^p B) One way put the first length then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types.
3683	2	0	a. Plastics A and B and C are more stretch resistant than plastic B and D. Also plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. ^p b. One ways they could of told us the IV, OV and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it.
3688	2	3	Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
3703	2	3	a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
3704	2	3	a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
3709	2	2	Based
3712	2	2	Conclusion: In conclusion, polymer plastic B had the most stretchability with 25mm, and polmer plastic A had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity. He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure.
3713	2	1	A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
3734	2	1	In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results.
3755	2	1	Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic.
3764	2	2	"In conclusion polymer plastic ""B"" is the plastic that stretched the most in this investigation. ^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic. Also, made each polymer plastic the sam length to  start with and test each one at the same time."
3770	2	2	My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct. Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. To improve this expiriment I would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also make sure that the temperature of the room I was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time.
3799	2	2	A)In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes. The plastic that was the stretchiest was plastic B.^p (B)Add a control with no weight added and a third trial.
3812	2	2	Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
3815	2	2	A. I conclude that plastic B worked the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic B works the best. ^P B. What they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup.
3820	2	2	Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
3825	2	0	In conclusion, this experiment is not accurate because it did not list the type of plastics that would be used for this experiment. The time was not even recorded. There has got to be evidence & throughout this experiment. For plastic type D, the amount stretched was the same by 20 min. I want to know what type of materials were used. ^p The student could have recorded the time and also show the type of materials that were used throughout the experiment.
3831	2	2	A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
3836	2	3	The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
3850	2	3	Nor.
3853	2	3	Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
3861	2	2	A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
3864	2	3	A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic. This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length. The next highest amount stretched, by plastic D, was an average of 20mm in length, showing that plastic B stretched the most. B) One way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as an outlier. They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Otherwise, for all the & prove they could've been changing these weights, which would've given them 2 independent variables, therefore, making their experiment invalid.
3865	2	3	One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
3867	2	2	Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials.
3870	2	2	Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
3874	2	1	Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase.
3889	2	2	Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least. Followed by B,D,C. Plastic A stretched the most with two mm. One way they could improve it is to test it more times. They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic.
3892	2	2	That plastic A was more durable than plastic B.^p For one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used.
3893	2	2	The conclusion that I have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results.
3895	2	3	a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
3908	2	2	A) That for the first trial plastic type B stretched more for the second trial plastic type B stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched.^p b) The two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using.
3911	2	2	"A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""A"" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight."
3925	2	2	a. The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least. ^p b. Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials. Another would be to make the procedure more understandable. And they should keep the weights on for longer, this will give more extensive and accurate data.
3937	2	2	(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
3938	2	1	A) Based on the data shown in the table. One strongest type of was plastic B. But plastic D had a costant amount of stretch. ^p B) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add. Also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment.
3939	2	0	b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
3954	2	3	a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
3955	2	3	a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
3959	2	1	A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same.
3969	2	2	a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
3982	2	2	The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
3983	2	2	a) In conclusion, it clear to see by looking at the data that plastic type B has the most stretchability.^p b) The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they would state that they used the same types of weights for each plastic. In addition, they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure.
3989	2	2	The polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type B with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second. Plastic type A had10 and 12, type C had 14 and 13, type D had 20 and 20. One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
3990	2	1	Overall, plastic type a stretched the most. Therefore, it must be weaker than the others. One way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics B, C, and D. They did not mention other plastics. Another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct.
3994	2	1	A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
3997	2	3	A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
4000	2	3	Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
4010	2	0	The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
4015	2	2	a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
4016	2	2	Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp.
4042	2	0	The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
4052	2	1	a) According to my results plastic type B had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm. I would rely on plastic type B to hold my things. ^p B) 1-st way the student's could have made theire results validity better one instead of putting plastic type A B C D they should have labeled them by what plastic they were. 2-nd the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking.
4930	3	1	A China panda eats almost nothing, but bamboo koalas bear eat eucalyptus leaves, those two animals are similar because they both eat a food amount of leaves or something that is green. Those two animals are different from pythons because pythons hurt and wrap their pray around them. Panda's and koala bears stay in rain forests, pythons you will mostly catch them in an hot enviroment.
4932	3	1	Panda's and koalas are both similar because they are specialist. They need a very specific climate to live or they will die. Pythons differ from these two animals because pythons are generalist. Pythons have a much broader range that they can survive in.
4934	3	1	"Pandas and koalas are similar because they need special environment and food to live, while pythons don't. To show the relationship between these creatures Mac Innes explains, ""What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability"". In other words, pandas and koalas need stability to thrive, while pythons doesn't."
4936	3	2	China's panda is similar to Australia's Koala because in the article it states that the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves constantly. they both only eat one thing and are different from pythons because they eat multiple things (not plants) and are more vicious.
4938	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are exclusively eating one food. ''A specialist is China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bear, which eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively . ''But they are different from pythons because pythons eat a much more vast assortment.
4939	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because, they eat plants only. The pandas eat nothing but bamboo. And as for the koalas they eat nothing but, eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. They're both different then pythons because, its a generalist.
4949	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. They eat almost nothing. They are both different from pythons because pythons are carnivors. They eat mammals. As pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat leaves.
4960	3	1	Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they only eat one thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons on the other are completely different because they have a large variety of what they eat. In 2005, a python swallowed an alligator, and later the python itself blew up.
4964	3	1	Pandas in  China are similar to koalas i Australia because they both prosper off mainly one food source and live in one part of the world unless they are taken away or raised somewhere else. A python differs from these animals because it can be found living in many places and eating many things.
4970	3	0	Chinas pandas and Australia's koala bears are similar because they each only eat one kind of food that it. The phython can eat anything pretty much. Thats how the phython is different from the pandas and koala. The koala eats eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat only bamboo.
4977	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koala bears in Australia beause they both eat plants and try to stay out of harms way. On the other hand pythons are different because they will eat anything from mice to alli gators and kill what is ever in its path.
4981	3	1	Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are both specialists. Both eat almost nothing but a certain type of plant from their native lands.

8108	4	2	Invasive in the context of this article means species, such as the Burmese python and the Nile monitor lizard, do not have predators here in the U.S to hunt them. This is very significant because this means their numbers cannot be kept in check and they might overpopulate. Complications will ensue without natural barriers for these species.
8118	4	0	The significants of the word invasive in this artical is to show how people view these species of animal as invasive, when really they were thought to be carried to the Everglades by Hurricane Andrew.

8135	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant in the article. MacInnes states "" Given the term invasive species is unfair. They're introduced ! I think that "" invasive "" is passing judgement."" He is saying that invasive is not the right term to describe these types of animals and that it gives them a bad connotation. It makes people think negatively of the species when they hear it. This is why ""invasive""is significant."
8137	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" is important in the article because the whole article is dedicated in educating people of the dangers of introducing an invasive species. In the article it describes how the python became an invasive species and how it is affecting the community and the environment. Not to mention they talk about invasive species become so."
8157	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" means to come into a place where something does not belong. This relates to article because pythons are coming into the United States when they should stay in their Asian homeland. When the pythons invaded the U.S. it scared many many people because they were not use to seeing pythons in their own homeland."
8164	4	1	Invasive species are species that were native one way but same how through time brought to another. Pythons due to Hunncan Andrew was brought through the south and scattered left their to find a new mean to food and survival.
8165	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant through the rest of the article because it talks about different species of animals and how they are diffrent and how they react.

8175	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article because. The pythons and other animals coming where there not welcomed like in the text it said how they was pulling pythons from under foriest cars."
8177	4	0	The word ''invasive'' is important to the article because if you don't know the meaning you won't entirely understand the article for. For example if your reaching the sentence that says ''MacInnes contends that the government overestimates the threat posed by invasive reptiles.'' you won't understand why he thinks the term ''invasive species'' is unfair.
8185	4	0	The significance of the word ''invasive'' is that they believe that invasive is unfair and that it's a passing judgment about the animals.
8186	4	0	To me an invasive species is something dangerous like a python for instance is a lot different than a kitten a koalas bear I think they also say invasive species because they're starting to spread.
8187	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" is used many times in the article to describe the reptiles that are being introduced to new environments. This is significat because it shows how reptiles invade other environments and destroy them, through feasting off of the animals native to the environment that aren't used to such a threat."
8190	4	1	I believe invasive means unacceptable because in the article, it talked about how snakes are pets and also unaccepted by other people. In paragraph 4, it explains how the reptile trade is becoming with 4.8 million household contains at least 1 reptile. Also in paragraph 11 skip snow complains about how the snakes are imperiling 5 endangered species.
8200	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" means invading. In paragraph 9, biologists are against invasive species like the python because they threaten biodiversity in the Everglades. A python is an invasive species because it is generalist (paragraph 20) meaning it can live anywhere and thrive."
8203	4	0	The significance of the invasive is describing how the pets come about .The government believes that the invasive animals tool over the new land why MacInnes feels that these new animals were just introduced the the new region the word is used in order to describe the two different view points. One is invasion of the land while the other view part is just introduction is it.
8207	4	1	"As MacInnes says, ""They're 'introduced', I think that invasive is passing judgement"". The word invasive is significant to the articles because the article has to do with these ""invasive"" species and how they are either being brought for about $ 600 dollars on are spreading East in the United States. The word also has to do with either the invasive species should be welcomed into a new environment."
8209	4	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive""is that they aren't welcomed or normal animals you'll see in a house. I still dont believe that's the right word to use them."
8215	4	1	The significance of invasive is to show how species move out of their environments and are into other environment and have to adapt.
8219	4	1	Invasive means that a species is taking over. It's not quite a positive word to be used. The whole article is to put pythons down and include they may take over and cause harm on the U.S by messing withe our ecosystem. This word really sends the biased negative thought.
8221	4	1	"when the word ""invasive"" is used, it comes with a negative connotation. It implies the species are coming and taking over the land. Roy MacInnes says it passes judgement. By using this word the reader may think poorly of the so called invasive species. It sets a bad tone."

8242	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" in this article is used often in paragraph 9, Biologist are referenced as saying that ""invasive species... are major threats to biodiversity.""

8254	4	1	Invasive is different to this article because of its meaning and because of the topic of this article which is about species particulary the snake which is invasive in a way were it can easily adapt to certain situations.
8258	4	1	Invasive implies that these animals are just brought to urban areas from their natural habitat, and they do not belong in homes. The article focuses on the possible threats of these animals, and their struggles to adapt to human surroundings even though.
8262	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" is significant to the rest of the article. The article shows how invasive species can be bad when it says ""are major threats to biodiversity."" Here, the word invasive applies and is significant because it proves a point. It shows the seriousness that the article is trying convay. It is also significant to show that the species were not originally there, like when the article talks about how the snakes got to the Everglades after Hurricane Andrew."
8268	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" to me means like invading, to take over. Lots of people think that these erotic animals from all over the world, would be ""invasive"" and escape there place were they live at and continuing a new life that would endanger people lives also."
8273	4	1	Invasive is almost like a question to this article. In paragraph 7 they are arguing if pythons are invasive or just introduced. Taking what I know from this paragraph I'd say invasive is something not natural or accustomed to a certain area.
8276	4	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" has alot to do with the rest of the article. It does because invasive species are pythons, pandas and koalas and thats what they were talking about."

9429	4	1	The word invasive is significant to this article because, this article is about species carrying/being  brought into new enviornment and rapidly increasing in population size. This article discusses specifically about pythons invading the everglades.
9430	4	0	The significance of the word invasive to the article is that it makes the author able to compare invasive animals to the endangered animals, with this the author is able to explain why invasive species like the python shouldn't be pets, just look at the title. The word invasive compares the pets to wild animals.
9454	4	2	In this article invasive means living in an environment where an organism shouldn't be. Pythons are constantly seen around the Everglades but that is not their homeland. Biologists are seeing them as invading an area that is not theirs, inhabiting it and harming the native animals.
9458	4	0	The word invasive is significant because reptiles are becoming invasive in the U.S. The number of reptile owners have doubled in the last decade.
9468	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the article is basically that there are many invasive reptiles being kept as pets or running around on open spaces when they should be kept in cages or somewhere where they cant cause harm to anyone or other species."
9477	4	1	Invasive in this article means that a generalist species take over a habitat. They can kill of  native species that are there, and decrease biodiversity.
9501	4	1	The world is getting crowded with all types of animals. Many invasive species ungergo a log before proliferating which means by the year of 2002. Pythons were seen in multiple locations all around the world. In the article, it even says how pythons were being found in car hoods.
9509	4	0	It is referring to invasive reptiles.
9515	4	1	"The significance of the word invasive is that it provides the reader with a clear concept that the generalists being held in households everywhere are invading different areas and populating there. These areas furthermore, are areas that had previously belonged to other species. Because of this, the author states, ""invasive species, unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity."""
9521	4	2	The word ''invasive'' is significant because it separates those are reptile impatalian and was against it. Animals call this reptiles invasive because they are a non-native species and are essentially invading our country. RobRay MacInnes, consumer of Glades here terms, thinks the term ''invasive'' species is unfair, he prefers the term ''introduced''. MacInnes thinks reptiles are a ''wonderful introduction'' while biologists consider them as ''major threat to biodiversity.''
9523	4	1	Invasive species are species that are introduced to a new habitat and consequently have no natural predators. Invasive species are significant to the rest of the article because the article is condemning the idea of importing reptiles into Florida because they become invasive species.
9530	4	0	Invasive is a passing judgement. They're are introduced. Pythons other snakes and reptiles.

9546	4	1	"""Invasive"" in this article means ""to take over"" or ""to invade"" It is a fairly important term in this articles because it describes the impact and consequenses of releasing a pet python into the wild."
9558	4	1	"In the article, ""one man's pet, anothers invasive species"", according to MacInnes, invasive is unfair and just a passing judgement. I think to people reptiles are just known to be dangerous so they put a label on them. But to people who deal with them like MacInnes, they're not and they should be treated like everyone else."
9563	4	1	The significance of the word invasive means that some species undergo a lag before proliferating, biologists say that ''invasive species unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity''.
9587	4	1	"I think the significance of the word "" invasive"" is ""passing judgement"". In the article says for a pythons its a good introduction because ""However invasive species unchecked by natural predators, are major threat to biodiversity for example a pythons, a crocodile, snakes, and other lethal species."
9591	4	1	The word ''invasive'' describes how certain genarlist species are invading and populating lands that are not their natural habitat. The article deals with the pros and ears of invasive species particularly pythons in the Southern United States it also conveys the slightly negative tone apporasted  throughout the article about invasive species.
9594	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" refers to the animals in this article meaning unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity."
9595	4	1	"The word Invasive  is significance to the article, one mens pet, another's  invasive species by Joel Achenbach. The government overestimated the threat passed by invasive reptiles, says Mac Innes. He also says that the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, and he thinks invasive is a passing judgement. This is how the word is invasive is significant to the article."
9607	4	0	Invasive describes all the species that was mentioned in the article and how they increasing.
9614	4	1	Invasive is important to the article because it explains what all the reptiles are that are not native to the certain area. Also it shows how a species in vades an area and sometimes completely messes up the food chain. Invasive implies that a certain species is bad.
9615	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" explains how the pythons have taken to being in their new, South Florida habitat. They have invaded Everglades National park and other areas around Florida where they are causing harm to other species such as alligators."
9617	4	1	"The word invasive suggests that something is invading, such as the pet reptiles. The article discusses if these pet reptiles are escaping and invading Florida's wilderness. The text says, ""The snakes are imperiling & endangered species in the Florida keys,"" (Achenbach 1). It is important to understand how the addition of such reptiles is excecting wildlife that we know."
9623	4	0	"The significance of the word ""Invasive"" is really used in a bad term in this story because the author is saying their invasive animals to most people, meaning their dangerous to us or can harm us."
9627	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" is important to the article because pythons are rapidly breading and are feeding on endangered species. Being invasive is to take over and eliminate, which is what the pythons are doing."
9639	4	1	Invasive means something becoming part of an environment it should not be in. Invasive organisms are causing trouble for organisms that belong in that environment.
9641	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that & how they would call all of the dangerous species. Also, that they would call them that cause they were a concern to the people because skip snow a wildlife biologist would have to move pythons out of the street and out from under tourist cars."
9643	4	0	"The word ""invasive"" is more significant to the rest of the artical. It is more significant because in the artical it says we are degrading the earth and we have to figure this out before its to late.

9651	4	1	"The significance of the word invasive isn't used nicely. MaccInnes "" disliked"" this word.He describes it as a unfitting word for snakes and other reptiles. He said that they were "" introduced"""
9655	4	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is that the whole article is telling you how the python isn't ""invasive"". The article says the python is not invasive it is just being introduced to the United States."
9657	4	1	Invasive is a very significant word in the article. What this 1word means is that something invades an area. They use the word toward all the animals that are invading as could invade the US and take over the US native animals. They mention that snakes could take out all the native snakes of America.
9662	4	0	"The word ""Invasive"" is significant in this story because here its talking about these harmful creatures, but one of the reasons to this story is to buy one of them, the carnavors are not usually a house pet, so why make it one?"

9693	4	0	"The significance of the word invasive means harmful and different. This can be supported through the article which states, ""such as the Burmese python...a toothy carnivore that reaches seven feet in length"". Here it is inferring that this invasive species ""Burmese python"" has dangerous features by using the words toothy carnivore and is different b/c it reaches seven feet in length which differs to other animals that I have seen."
9698	4	2	The word invasive is significant because it explains briefly what will happen when the species alters an unknown habitat. When an invasive species is introduced to an environment, it will complete to an indigenrous species food source. If this happens, the competition may leave the native species endangered or even intimet. When it is survival of the fittest, those without competition have an advantage over those who compete with invasive species.
9705	4	0	"The word invasive is significance to the rest of the article because it debates whether some of the species are invasive or not. It says in the article. ""Even the term ""invasive species"" is unfair, he said they're introduced. I think that 'invasive' is passing judgement."""
9707	4	1	''Invasive'' has alot to do with this article, it's showing us how pythons are slowing invading our homes and invade the southern part of the US because they must stay in a climate similar to their ''Asian homeland.''
9715	4	1	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" is to show how much other species are taking over the biodiversity of a certain area. This word  takes on a rather meaning says MacInnes and he would prefer to use introduced which is clearly that happened since according to the article the animals that are causing problems were brought over."
9716	4	1	"The Significance of the word invasive to the rest of the article's that, these species are a treat to the biodiversity of the world. In the text it states, ""biologists however, say that invasive species, unchecked by natural predators are major threats to biodiversity."" If these species are speading and multiplying to fast, then in some way, that would affect other animals and they would have to readjust."
9721	4	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in this article is to show the reader that it's sort risky but worth purchasing certain reptiles. In the article they say how invasive is like passing judgement. The use of this word is to explain that there are plenty of pros and cons."

9729	4	2	"The word "" Invasive"" is a significant part of the article because that is what the author, Achen boch, wants to enable to the sender. He wants to show how these creatures are literally invading, with the help of humans, a different ecosystem. In the article it says that these species, unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity."
9735	4	2	The word is important because it basically mean the pythons are lets go thes arenot naturalto the eviorment and they come in and kill all other animals and spread withoat and pretitors the python we make other animals extinsion.
9756	4	1	Some people think these animals are invasive because they are dangerous, and that they should be left in their habitats. But others, like RobRoy Mac Innes, see these animals as harmless and good for pets.
9762	4	2	The word invasive is significant to the rest of the article because some claim that breaking the natural barriers allows animals to invade new enviroments and bring native animals to extinction. They think its a major threat to the food chain and to biodiversity.
9769	4	1	"RobRoy MacInnes is co-owner of Glades Herp Farms. He thinks the term ""invasive"" is passing judgement. I think the word 'invasive' has to do with extinction and danger just by the way they put it in the tittle and how they explained it throughout the article."

9777	4	1	"The word ""invasive"" reffers to the term ""invasion"". The article is stating that generalists are invading most of the world and are more abundant than specialists. It is because as paragraph # 23 states, ""what favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability. Right, now, mankind has chosen to make earth a rapidly changing place""."
9781	4	1	"The word invasive is significant to this article. It is because of this article, there are two sides, one who believes these animals are ""invasive"" and one who feels they are being introduced. They are invasive because they have major threats to biodiversity and what would happen when the natural barriers are removed. On the the other hand for example, RobRoy MacInnes believe these animals are a wonderful introduction."
9786	4	0	"The word invasive means that the animal or thing is now, it tells about how it can be either good or harmful to allow invasive species into an area. The reason why is because MacInnes explained that pythons are introduced and invasive is just ""passing"" judgement."
9788	4	0	"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is sort of like invasion of these types of reptiles and how us humans are scared of them so we tried to stay away. In the article it states, "" A snake like that, coming at you you'd leave alone or simply die of fright.""  Bearing that if you see one you must leave it more."
9789	4	0	Invasive is described as not being introduced and that it is too harsh of a word to be used in this contest.
9790	4	2	Invasive means that a species, not native to the particular area it was introduced to; overpopulares and causes extinction to other species. This is relative to the article because the article talks about how pythons are becoming an invasive species in Florida and even endangered the key Largo wood rat.
9798	4	0	The significance of the word invasive is to show us the reader that this reptiles are a strong group of reptiles very dangerous than others.

Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.

Active transport requires protiens to move substances asroos the cell membrane against the concentration gradient. Vesicles are 'pouches' that the cell uses to transport large particles it suronds the object and pinches it off.
15321	6	2	Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.      Type one is passive transport. This occurs when the cell dosen't use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane.     Type two is active transport. This occurs when the cell uses energy to transport the material across the cell membrane.     Type three is mamma mia here we go again my my how can i forget you

15343	6	0	There are many ways a cell controls the movement if substances across the cell membrane.  One of them would be by only letting things go from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration to maintain homeostasis.  Another way is when a receptor protein is triggered to make a channel move things in or out of the cell. A third thing is when a pump is told by the nueclus to work.

15704	6	0	the nucleus, the cell membrane
15708	6	0	One process the cell uses to move substances across the membrane, is through the nucleus. The Nucleus of a cell contains genetic material called DNA which tells the cell which processes to do, this process includes movement across the cell.  Secondly, The cell membrane in general is a regulator of what can and cannot enter and exit the cell.  Last of all, in the process of transfering DNA to other parts of the cell, mRNA moves across the cell to ribosomes, in order for the DNA to be processed and used for a specific cause. This example is a more specific way that shows how cells control movement within the membrane.
15719	6	2	One process to move particles across a membrane is osmosis. Osmosis is moving water across a membrane. There is hypertonic osmosis, which is moving water out, hypotonic, which is moving water in, and isotonic which is equal water moving in and out. Another process is using a protein channel. The protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids. Another process if diffusion, which is moving particles from high concentration to low concentration.

The mitochondria is like the cells organizer, it balances out the substances and sends them where they need to go.
15725	6	0	One way the cell controls the movement across the membrane is by knowing where to go. Aniother way is by swimming to where it needs to go, and the last way i moves is by just moving there.

An example of this is when Rose's sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay. She tells Anna that they need to do this for thier brother, and that in the end he can help them get to where they want to be. She also jokes about money with Anna as if things were alright with money at this time.

17566	7	0	She is stressed. Example When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?
17571	7	1	When Rose speaks with Anna you can tell that she wants to be hopeful. She says that Paul getting a job will allow money for her and Anna to go to college, but the fake laugh shows that she is sceptical just like Anna.
17580	7	1	Rose is emotionally strong and hopefull.  She provides words of encouragement to her little sister when Anna is doubting their family.  She is responsible in the fact that she has a job, goes to school, and helps out around the house when her parents are not there.
17589	7	0	Rose can be emberassed. When Rose was talking to her aunt Kolab she just kepted nodding, she didn't say much. that makes me think that she is emberassed.

17661	7	0	Rose's conversations between Anna and her herself show how independent she is. When talking to her younger sister, she acts like her mother and watches over Anna. Instead of ignoring her sister like some older siblings may do, Rose asks Anna what is the matter and checks to see if she's alright. As Anna continues to worry, Rose tries to reassure her that things will be fine in the future as long as they work together. Rose assumes the responsibility in the absence of her mother and doesn't rely on anyone to do work for her.
17667	7	1	Rose is very strong, she had to show no emotion with little sister, Anna. Anna was angry that her father has been away for so long. But Rose is explaining to Anna that he needs to make money to  keep Paul in school. Rose misses her dad too, and wishes they didn't have to work so hard to make money, but she has to be strong for her sister.
17682	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose is she is a  understandying person and takes advice from her elders very well. An example from the article is; (last paragraph) Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.Maybe it wouldn't. But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter. (line 21) Rose nodded.

17685	7	2	Rose cares for others feelings in the 19th paragraph rose didn't want to teel the truth to her aunt because it would hurt her feelings.
17696	7	1	She's helpful. She doesn't quite like all the work she must do but she continues to help and tries not to complain even though her Aunt Kolab can tell how Rose feels by listening to her dream. She didn't ask for a relief of her helping efforts but she did appreciate it but is still willing to help if she is needed to.
17700	7	1	She is caring of her family by trying to make Anna feel better about their situation.
17703	7	0	Rose is somewhat selfish compared to the rest of her family.  They had had to brave coming to America from Cambodia.  Rose had no idea what Cambodia was like and how bad it was there.
17704	7	0	Rose doesn't beleive in Paul.
17710	7	2	Based on her conversation with Anna, one can deduce that a defining characteristic of Rose is her selflessness. It is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college. She is understanding of the family's position and is doing everything in her power to improve it.
17719	7	0	She is very angry for some reason
17721	7	0	When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab. I think that Rose is just being selfish and just doesn't want to help out with anything. She's basically only thinking about herself. 'Maybe I can sew for the ladies or make special treats and sell them'. Her aunts offer made her feel lighter.
17723	7	0	She is very devoted to her school work, she won't give up. In the story when Rose is talking to Anna she talks about her essay, then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she talks about her topic for her essay.
17724	7	0	That Rose and her aunt both know how Rose feels in their family situation.Rose's aunt asks her 'Do you really feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
17725	7	2	One trait is that Rose is a caring person, that loves and respects her aunt. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose did not expose her dream to her aunt because she did not want to hurt her's or her mother's feelings.
17726	7	0	I think Rose felt frustrated or weighed down on by her family. Aunt Kolab mentioned to Rose that her parents and Aunt Kolab went through similar situations in Cambodia.
17729	7	0	' Do you feel so wighed down by what you're doing to help  this family?' Rose feels too much pressure on herself. She has bad dreams

17735	7	0	Rose is strong. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, she is careful because she doesn't want to reveal to her aunt that she is exhausted from working and going to school. Rose fears that tis may dissapoint her aunt and her mother. She feels weighed down from all of her responsibilites and doesn't think that all of this is necessary. But she does this with a good heart.
17743	7	1	'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'      This statement shows that Rose feels like she is under a lot of pressure but doesn't want to say anything because she will feel guilty for not helping. Aunt Kolab realizes this and tried to help by saying that things were done differently where they grew up in comparison to Rose. This helps Rose a lot because now she knows that someone is there to help because Rose is too young to have to be worrying about helping get money and should be worried about school.
17744	7	1	I believe that rose feels tired, but she still wants to help her family. In the story her aunt asked ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' I believe she does feel weighed down, but she is a hard worker and that is her trait I am speaking of.
17747	7	2	Rose is very considerate. She did not want to Aunt Kolab her real feelings on the situation because she was afraid it was going to hurt her. Instead, she decided to take in all the responibilites given to her and do the best with them and that concluded to Rose possibly having a change in her life.
17763	7	0	Rose has faith. At the beginning of the story she was almost stressed at the fact that she had to write an essay and hadn't started yet, but then by the end of the story she realized that her family and the way they were doing things is to help each other. Then since she never gave up on the essay all of a sudden the idea came to her of her essay topic.
17765	7	0	One of the main characteristics that appears in the story is burdened. When she is dreaming of her brother like a stone on top of her in the water, it displays the pressure and the burden that she is plagued with.
17766	7	2	Rose is a caring person. One reason she is caring is because in line 19, she didn't want to hurt her family by telling them the truth. The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family.
17772	7	0	They are try to see if Rose is having too much work for her to handly by herself. Since she have school to do to, the restaurant for a four-hour shift, then help out with the family.
17783	7	2	A trait I can identify from Rose's conversations is that she cares about people in her famil.  For example in paragraph nineteen it say's Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17789	7	1	Rose is hard working and a very respectful girl,the story states, 'if she told the truth,she would hurt her aunt.And her aubt would probably tell her mother.'
17794	7	0	stressed out because she has to help out her family and do her school work.
17795	7	1	Rose is a hard worker and always is pushing herself to the limit. This is proved by her taking on the tasks of helping her aunt as well as the essay. Even though she is busy, she tries to make time for all that is necessary.
17797	7	1	Rose is helpful, because she helps her aunt make dinner.
17798	7	1	Based on her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose seems to be quite understanding. When Anna complains to Rose about their father being away Rose takes the time to explain to Anna why it is their father is in that situation. Instead of instantly reverting back to her own interests Rose makes the effort to consider everyone else and absorb the whole situation before talking about it to her sister.
17804	7	2	I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring. An example from the passage would be when Rose professes that 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' I beleive this quote shows Rose's willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life. Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life.
17824	7	0	Rose is a type of person that think s about her furture. She can just picture her brother getting he diloma and makeing her parents pround of him. Knowing that their lives rest in what her brother dose, it makes her think about a lot of stuff.
17827	7	2	One trait that Rose possesses is being compasionate towards others.  An example of this is when she is talking with Anna and says, 'Anna, What's wrong?  You feel okay?'

17832	7	0	Rose exemplifies the trait of self doubt. Rose constantly ponders the idea of her life becomming easier but never truly beleives herself.

Rose is showing self doubt in this situation by not thinking her life cause become easier and instead thinking her life may become easier.
17847	7	1	Rose is responsible within her family. She cares about her sister Anna when Anna feels disheartened. Also, Rose feels that she needs to help out her family and do all she can to help, even when it is difficult.
17854	7	1	She isn't self centered. She realizes how other people sees her situation.'But now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here.... This must be difficult for you. Yes?'Rose nodded.
17855	7	2	Rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story. In neither of the conversations does she want to hurt the other ones feelings so Rose hides her fellings to make sure the other is not hurt.
17861	7	1	Rose represents herself as a very strong-willed person. Despite the situation that she is in with a geographically distant father and a working mother, she is able to live a busy life. While working and going to school, she maintains the mental health to interact with her family and help them as well. Though she may feel overwhelmed, when Rose speaks to her Aunt Kolab, she quickly regains her positivity, and moves on. This ability to continue under the pressures of a busy life is associated with a strong-willed personality, possessed by Rose.
17867	7	0	Rose is very upset with her family.  She works all the time for her brother and doesn't get anytime for herself to do school work or hang out with friends.  In paragraph 23 her aunt offers her something that somehow make her feel lighter.
17871	7	0	If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
17877	7	0	One trait that I think can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is overworked because in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' I think that quote from the story shows that she is overworked.
17888	7	0	The relationship between Anna and Aunt Kolab sems good because in the story they are able to talk out there problems with each other nd can also express how they are feeling.
17890	7	0	She thought she would she could get a trip to Sacramento to receive a prize, and she had already missed a lot of shifts, and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.

17923	7	2	Caring,Rose asks her sister what is wrong, and if she feels okay.
17943	7	0	Rose's aunt sugests making treats from their country and selling them. Aunt Kolab wants to share their Cambodian tradition with the people of their new country and help them understand Cambodian tradition, while at the same time she wants to make some money to help the family out.

17950	7	2	Rose is very hopeful. In the passage the author states 'Rose kept nodding. Mayber her life would get easier.'
17953	7	0	She understands and listens to what others have to say. When Anna was talking to her, Rose helped her out. She explained and help Rose understand some things. She tried her best to make Anna not feel so lonely.     When she had a conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose didn't really talk about much. She doesn't like to talk about her feelings. She likes to keep her feelings bottled up inside.
17976	7	0	She was stressed about the competition and how she was going  to enter when she has a job to attend to. She talks about this and the dream she had because she was also conserned if it meant something in her life that has been currently being going on. To support this answer she says, 'Even if i were to win, she thought, I won't get to travle to Sacramento to recieve the prize.'
17984	7	2	One trait that can describe Rose is supportive.  As Rose talks to Anna in this story she keeps telling Anna how everything will work out.  Rose has other thoughts about the situation, but she keeps them to her self to make her younger sister feel better about the situation.  She tells Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  This shows that Rose, no matter how weighted down she feels, will always give a supportive answer for her sister to make things seem alright.
17986	7	0	In this short story, Rose is having a conversation with her sister about how she is sad that her Papa has to work somewhere else for money. It states 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her (Rose).' which tells the reader that Rose is trying to hide how tired she is, and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family. From that aspect of the story, Rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family.
17988	7	1	Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things. I think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasn't done yet. But i think that she just had to realize what he most important thing was after all.
17989	7	1	She worries about everyone except herself.She feels that she has to take on a big responsibility for her family.

18016	7	0	One trait that I believe can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is calm. I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.
18018	7	1	She is someone who can get very discouraged easily. Cause she is always worried about how late her mom has to work. Also about getting all her homework done then going strait to work. She thinks she is always pushed for time.
18019	7	1	that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do
18023	7	0	One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is with Aunt Kolab, Rose is an American, she doesn't remeber Cambodia, therefore Aunt Kolab has to teach her of Cambodia, with Aunt Kolab deciding to bring a little of Cambodia to America when Aunt Kolab says, 'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.' and 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.'.
18038	7	2	I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul. She also helps out Aunt Kolab.

18062	7	1	One trait that can describe Rose is that she is hard working, one detail from the story that can support my answer is that she goes strait from school to her job which is a four-hour shift, and then when she gets home from work she goes right to doing her homework.

18439	7	0	From paragraph 19 I could tell that Rose is a very modest person. I got the feeling that she doesn't like to bother people. She even says 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' Therefore she clearly does not want to burden anyone.

18463	7	0	ROSE DIDNT ANSWER
18472	7	1	Rose is an independent person.  She can do things for herself.  She seems to like to appear tough to her family, like she has everything together, and she can get along just fine.  It seems that Rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family.  Rose is also caring deep down, and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down.     When Anna spoke to Rose about their brother Paul, Anna seems guarded.  She doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother.  Anna tells Rose that she sounds just like their mother because she talks of how they really needed the money for which their father was working.
18473	7	0	Rose is very shy, but also likes to get what she wants. She likes things to be her way. In the story Aunt Kolab says 'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.'
18474	7	2	Rose is very respectfull of her elders. When she was speaking with her Aunt Kolab about how she felt weighed down by the responsibilities put on her, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
18477	7	0	She wants to be succesful. She says when she is talking to Anna she says 'Only if you have everything.' And how she says about traveling to Sacramento to recieve a prize.
18495	7	1	A trait that stood out to me the most about Rose has to be how caring about her family she is. An example is how she goes to lay down with her younger sister to comfort her.
18496	7	2	Rose is kind at heart. She knows she has a job to look out for her family. She says' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' This shows that she cares about her family.

18499	7	1	One trait Rose has is that she is understanding even if she has so much pressure put on her. When she was talkinf with Aunt Kolab, she would understand what her aunt was trying to explain.
18500	7	2	One trait that describes Rose is respectful. When Rose's Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down, Rose did not answer. She did not ansewer because she was afraid to hurt the Aunts feelings. Rose does the same when she surpresses how she feels when is her sister is upset.
18525	7	0	She tries to see things from another point of view.
18530	7	2	I believe the story reveals that Rose is a caring person. The evidence behind my reasoning is when Rose said, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish collge. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for our college.'. The reason I chose this part of the story is because I believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, and by saying this to her it's allowing her sister to feel better about the situation. Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister.
18532	7	0	Rose tends to feel uncomfortable with expressing her inner struggles. While talking to Anna, Anna tells her, 'You sound just like Mama,' illustrating that Rose covers her feelings by saying what she feels is expected of her.

18605	7	1	Rose seems like she does alot to help her family, and it is hard on her because shes still young. She's a strong person, and would most likely do everything she could to help her family. Rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt, and now she feels like things might get easier.
18609	7	0	Rose is not very happy that her father had to go away for his job. When she wakes for her bad dream she goes to talk to Anna about how she feels.

If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.
18680	7	0	She feels like everything is hard for her, her essay, her job, moving from a different country, it would be hard for her. She feels suppressed from pauls achievements, because he has graduated from high school and is getting worried because her family doesn't have alot of money for school.
18683	7	0	Rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing. She doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that.
18686	7	1	Rose is loving and cares for her familybut she is scared and lonely. Rose is scared f being lonely and misses her family very much. Rose expresses her feelings of loneliness.
18692	7	2	One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings. I think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down Rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didn't want to hurt her.

18714	7	0	What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation.

I also think that this shows her character is a very driven person.
18716	7	1	One of the traits that Rose has based on her conversation with her Aunt Kalob, she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right, and go better. An example of this is that she goes to school, and has a job right after school, leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself. But she wants ans needs to help her family out.
18722	7	0	She is very protective of her family. She wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out. She has a strong sense of duty. You can see this by how she goes straight from school, to work a long shift, to help her aunt make dinner.

18737	7	2	Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna. She really understands Anna's resentment and frustration as her dream reveals, but she replies to Anna with answers that predict a bright future for her and Anna saying, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to colloge.'

He wanted Paul to run so he could excel at something like Mr. Leonard did. They both had the same feelings of embarrassment for their lack of ability to read.
19995	8	2	During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was an athlete who didn't go far due to his poor reading skills. This information, made Paul feel more comfortable because he became aware that Mr. Leonard had the same problem that he has. They're both good athletes who have trouble reading.
20000	8	2	The effect it has on paul, is to motivating. Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great track runner in college. Paul is motivated because Mr. Leonard had the same problems Paul is sturggling with.
20002	8	2	When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed very suprised. He had no idea that Mr. Leonard was a good athelete or that he had reading trouble before. When he found out about this information, he was very empethetic. He said 'It's time to start your training.' in support for him.

In return to Mr. Leonard helping him, Paul now wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since this is the reason he flunked out of college.

At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard 'It's time to start your training.', indicating that he is going to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20072	8	2	He understands why he was helping him out with the hurdles. It was like his obstacle in school when he didn't know how to read, but his friends helped him out through school and the learning center for Paul was like Mr. Leonards friends. But once he got to college his friends weren't there to help him out anymore. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to go onto college and make records and do what he wanted to do when he was in colloege but couldn't because he couldn't read and thats what made him drop out.
20080	8	2	He knows where Leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either. He then wants to help Leonard because he had helped him with track.I found this out from the last two paragraphs of the story.
20099	8	1	Mr. Leoanrd's background taught Paul a valuable lesson on doing well academically and in sports. For example, Mr. Leonard words were familiar to Paul and they were feelings of embarrassment.
20102	8	2	Mr. Leonard's story has a powerful effect on Paul.  It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles.  Many people have gone through what he is going through.  They had a lot in common.  Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability.  Paul is actually lucky.  When Mr. Leonard was in school, they didn't have learning centers to help people read.  Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received.      Paul looks at what he has been given and the time and effort Mr. Leonard has put into him and decides that he should give something back.  He takes Mr. Leonard to the school for some 'training' in reading.
20106	8	1	It has an effect on Paul becuse it sounds just like him. Paul cant read very well at all. He gets help which Mr. Leonard did not really have the chnce to get help from teachers only students. Paul want to exel in school and track. He wanted to over come his obsticals. The hurdels repersent the obsticals in life and Paul could over come them if he just trye. Paul is trying his very beast to become the beast on the team and at school.
20118	8	2	The information that Paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something. When Mr. Leonard asked Paul about the learning center Mr. Leonard let paul go after he told him he couldnt read. Now the information that Paul got effected him by making him realize that since he cat read it doesnt mean that he cant be good at other things like sports. Because after Paul gave the information printout to Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard told him that since he couldnt read he had to quite track because he couldnt read and because of his grades in school. And after he was told that Paul realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the sense that they both couldnt read and that since Mr. Leonard helped him Paul has to help Mr. leonard learn to read.
20119	8	1	After learing this background information, Paul realizes why Mr. Leonard is just like him.
20126	8	2	Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's background information because Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul and Mr. Leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school. Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody.
20140	8	0	The effect of the background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard is Paul now knows that he is not the only one with a hard time. It helps Paul realize that everyone is good at one thing while another may be harder to accomplish.
20149	8	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, like himself. He also found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he couldn't go any further in track than he did because he couldn't read. With finding that out Paul wanted to go further so he knew he needed to work hard to improve on his reading and also that maybe him and Mr. Leonard could work on it together.
20151	8	2	The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help Mr Leonard. It surprises Paul because he asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star. The information also encourages him because at the end of the reading Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20152	8	2	He finds out that mr. Leonard is a poor reader and Paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder.
20169	8	0	The background that Paul got of Mr.Leonard effected him possitively. Now that Paul knows just because you can't read doesn't mean you can't do anything you put your mind to.
20171	8	0	Paul is in the same situation as Mr. Leonard. When mr. Leonard asked Paul what his name is  he should of known it because he had check Paul's pass for the past two weeks, but Mr/ Leonard did not know it because he could not read.
20173	8	2	Mr. Leonard helps Paul find something that he can be good at, and Paul probably takes Mr. Leonard's kindness for granted. He is certainly grateful for Mr. Leonard's kindness, but fails to see Mr. Leonard's motives. When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's background, about his track and field records and how he flunked out of college, it profoundly changes Paul's view of Mr. Leonard.      According to Paul, 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed. Mr. Leonard's story also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return, by helping him improve his reading skills.
20174	8	0	Mr. leonard is like Paul, a poor reader. so he feels bad for him. also he sees himself in him by taking him to the track. He is good at track just like he was. Also he was a poor reader and thats why he flunked out of college.
20177	8	0	Paul ask Mr. Leonard why he kept such a proud accomplishment from him.
20178	8	0	The background information helps paul by relizing if you want ot become a good athlete you have to be an even better student to do what you like do to.
20201	8	0	Paul was amazed by what he found out about Mr.Leonard. He found out that Mr.Leonard was a freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records.
20205	8	0	Paul needs help and needs to work more harder on the way he exercises. Paul needs to be concentrated and very smart to try new things.
20219	8	2	In the story paul learns that mr. leonard was very talented at hurdles and even broke records as a college freshman. I think that this information paul learns has him a little confused on what happend to make Mr. Leonard in the postion that he is today. when Mr. Leonard explains to him that he wasnt the strongest student and cant read very well it ties the whole story together and i think paul then realizes why Mr. leonard wants to train him. In  the end of the story they kinda let us believe that paul is going to now help mr. Leonard with his reading.
20220	8	2	Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was such a famous track star. He was in shock when he found out tht Mr. Leonard had won so many trophy's and that he won the 400 meter in hurddles.
20223	8	1	After learning about Mr. Leonard's background, I think Paul starts to understand Mr. Leonard better.  He used to be a suspicious quiet man but now Paul feels that he and Mr. Leonard are alike in the fact that they both had trouble in school. Paul feels more comfortable knowing that Mr. Leonard is like him and that he understands how Paul feels.
20232	8	2	Mr. Leonard use to be a big track star. He was amd excelent athlete but just like Paul, he struggled with learning and reading. He kept the information about his past away from Paul because he was extremely embarassed about him failing, and flunking out of college.          When Paul found out about Mr. Leonards accomplishments, he was confused as to why he never said anything to him. Then Mr. Leonard explained to him about how he was never a very good student but colleges didn't care because he was such a greath athlete. When Paul is told that he was a awful reader also, he felt compelled to ivite Mr. Leonard to his learning center.
20235	8	2	I think it gives Paul some encourgement knowing that he was taught and trained by a national winner in track. It alos opens up a few connections he as with Mr. leonard about being able to talk about track instead of just the learnign center.Mr. Leonard is a role model of Paul
20242	8	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is both a track star and a poor reader. They display some of the same traits. Paul is empathetic towards Mr. Leonard and vice-versa because of their similarites. Paul even suggests he can relate to Mr. Leonard's embarrassment of not finishing college. Mr. Leonard saw the same characteristics in Paul that he saw in himself, and helped him to excell at something. In the same way, Paul wishes to assist Mr. Leonard to achieve something.
20248	8	0	He is curious on what happened to Mr. Leonard and wants to know more about him.

20256	8	0	HE CANT READ SO HE FEELS BAD FOR HIM
20257	8	1	The background information on Mr. Leonardo made Paul want to work harder.
20260	8	2	I believe it makes paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard is. It helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard has been helping him and encouraging him to do his best at the hurdles. he also realizes that those two are very much the same, because they both aren't good at reading
20267	8	0	He is concerned about why Mr. leonard didn't tell him. He wants to help him overcome his problems, he tells him  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
20280	8	0	The background information saddens Paul because Mr. Leonard never told Paul about his background. Paul was confused on why he was never told, even after all the training.
20284	8	0	The background information about Mr. Leonard has an effect on Paul. Since Paul knows that Mr. Leonard fluncked out, he wants to be able to overcome the obstacles he faces in life and make Mr. Leonard proud.
20297	8	2	The background information he recieves gives him a new outlook on Mr. Leonard and he decides to ask him about what he read. When he finds out the whole story he decides to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
20299	8	0	He figures out that Mr.Leonard didnt want to tell him about the college experiance becuase he was afraid that it would discourage him.
20303	8	2	Well, the strongest effect that website about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was shock and suprise. if I were Paul I would be honored that a former track star was willing to work with me. And train me. But yes I am shure that Paul was very suprised once he looked up the website.
20321	8	2	Paul was very suprised that he didn't tell him. Mr. Leonard is embarrassed for flunking out of college. Mr. Leonard didn't want Paul to think poorly of him for flunking out even though he was a wonderful athlete. Paul greatly appreciated that an old star was helping him with his hurdles now.

20353	8	1	He realizes that even though he can't read he can still be good at something but if he wants to be good at the hurdles he still has to get good grades. Mr. Leonard showed him that he will face obstacles in life but there is always a silver lining if he just looks for it.
20354	8	1	I think paul was surprised by the background information on Mr. Leonard. Yet I think he was more incouraged.
20355	8	2	Paul suddenly realizes why this janitor was helping him out so much.

20413	8	0	Paul didn't know that Mr. Leonard was good at track and broke records. He was kind of upset because Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he couldn't read and flunked out of college.
20417	8	1	In many cases Leonard and Paul have much in common. Paul never learned to read neither did Leonard. Leonard encouraged Paul to do Track Paul could relate to Leonard.
20435	8	2	It shows Paul that no matter what, you need to learn to do things your own self and that no matter how hard the obsticle is, you put all your effort and practice and you will get better. Mr. Leonard didn't know how to read and he found out the hard way that you can't relay on anyone, you will have to learn by yourself. Pual finds out about Mr. Leonard and figures out that all he wants to do is to help Pual to become better and learn  about hard times that he has had in the past and he does not want Pual to have the same problem he did.
20437	8	0	The effect it had was that he got him into sports. He helped Paul he wanted to make him do better in life. And just to do the right things. That's why he was asking so many questions and getting him to come to the gym after school.
20438	8	1	In the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star. It makes Paul wonder why he wan't told and makes him want to ask Mr. Leonard. When Paul asks, Mr. Leonard tells him about his experience in college and about how he flunked out. Paul seems shocked and figures out that Mr. Leonard was trying to help him get good at something. He also repsected that Paul was trying to get help with his problem reading other than relying on others.
20445	8	0	I think it had a bad feeling on Paul at first just for the fact that he didnt tell him. But once he got to know him he may have thought there is a ligit reason to why he didnt tell him.
20448	8	2	As the story begins the reader learns Mr. Leonard is simply a hall monitor doing his job, no one really seems to take notice in him and school goes on in the same way it always does. It isn't until Paul gets stopped by Mr. Leonard one day that we first get a glimpse of who this hall monitor is. Many foreshadowing events occur from this point forward- the empathy in his eyes when he learns Paul can't read, the mysterious way he calls Paul to the gym and then to the track, and even the encouragement he gives to Paul gives the reader many hints on who this character is as a person. When the track coach gives Paul some interesting information to look up about this said hall monitor, that is when we really see who Mr. Leonard was. We learn how successful he was on the track, but when asked about this we also learn how unsuccessful he was off the track. Paul is very shocked to hear Mr. Leonard Grabowski was an avid hurdle jumping track participent in his day, but when he goes directly to the man behind all of it, Mr. Leonard, he gets a more personal outlook on what it was truly like for him. This gives Paul a new appreciation for his education, but also for Mr. Leonard after realizing just who this hall monitor once was, and in a way- still is.
20456	8	2	The background information Paul gets about Mr. Leonard effects Paul becuase, he learns that Mr. Leonard has the same feelings, and the same problem he does. That makes Paul feel like he isn't alone, and that he could try to help Mr. Leonard with the same problem Paul has with reading. It also makes him feel like he can acheive things, that he didn't know he could.
20460	8	2	when paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in colleg he then understands why he wants him to learn track because of the simularities they both have.
20479	8	2	In my understanding it seemed like he was all around surprized because Mr. Leonard was a track star and the fact he had a reading problem. For the kind and friendly training Mr. Leonard did, Paul felt he should return the favor and help him to read.
20483	8	2	When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is surprised. Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard had been a track star. This information encouraged Paul to strive in learning to read. At the same time Paul could relate to him. Paul himself has trouble with reading so he felt empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
20493	8	0	The information he get is about Mr.Lenonard winning a track meet when he was in high school.
20494	8	1	The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard, has a effect on him beacuse he also can not read. Mr. Leonard is a great guy and to find out he has the same problem as him just makes it a little easier to understand where hes coming from.Like he flunked out of college but he was so good in sports, it kinda shows Paul that he can do anything as longs as you have a good education.
20497	8	2	Finding out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read made Paul want to help him learn just like Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at jumping hurdles in track.
20510	8	0	paul might thought that he did not know what he was doing.
20531	8	1	The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is really powerful. Paul realizes that this teacher isn't just some other annoying teacher. Mr. Leonard was in the exact same boat as Paul was in, and gave him advice on how to overcome it and encouragement to let Paul know he could do it, depsite being unable to read very well.
20543	8	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college, which seems to inspire him. He wanted to know about his experience and as Mr. Leonard told him about it, Paul began to realize that he and Mr. Leonard were pretty similar. Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run and do hurdles, and Paul wanted to help teach Mr. Leonard something.
20546	8	2	Paul realizes that the learning center will only help him, and that he doesn't want to lose his dreams like Mr. Leonard did because he can't read.  Mr. Leaonard tol dhim that nobody wants a track star that can't read, and when Paul realizes this he knows that he has to try to make what he wants in life happen.
20548	8	1	The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard motivated him.  It showed Paul that he could succed in something other than reading, just as Mr. Leonard did.  Just like the confidence Paul showed when talking to Mr. Leonard after he found out about Mr. Leonard's past.
20553	8	0	After Paul was informed about Mr. Leonard's backround he seems to get closer to Mr. Leonard because they had a lot more in common then he had thought. Both Mr. Leonard and Paul had trouble with reading which caused Mr. Leonard to want to help Paul.
20561	8	2	At the beginning of the story, Paul is having trouble in school. Reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports. The hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, decides to help Paul by coaching him in hurdling. Paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds. His coach was a freshman at college when he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, and broke records. The problem was, Mr. Leonard had dropped out of college because he was failing: he couldn't read very well either. Just like Paul, school was too difficult for him and he had to give up what he loved because no other college would accept him. Paul was moved by this, and decided to get Mr. Leonard a tutor so he could reapply to a college and live his dream.
20564	8	2	The effect the background background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is he can empathsize with Mr. Leonard.      Paul struggled reading, and then Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles and track. When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college, even after being a big track star, ''the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'' Paul related to Mr. Leonard's failure of college and  the fact he couldn't read because Paul also struggled in it.      The effect it had on Paul was the he was familiar with the feeling. It is foreshadowed in the last sentence that since Mr. Leonard gave his time up to help Paul excel at hurdles, he was going to help Mr. Leonard at reading.
20577	8	2	He could feel what Mr. Leonard was feeling, and he felt as if he needed to help with out with something, just as he helped Paul. So, he was going to teach him how to read.
20590	8	2	The backround information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard effects him in a positive way, because it makes Paul feel like someone else has gone through exactly what he is going through at that moment in time. Mr. Leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, because no school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul goes on to say that he knows Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarassment all to well, happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud, or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class.
20603	8	0	He was disturbed that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him that he was a star athlete in track, and was wondering why he didnt tell him.     Mr. Leonard told him to look the coach, and he did, but he looked up Mr. Leonard as well and thats how he learned that he was in college track.
20615	8	2	The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking. Paul had no clue that he was being coached by one of the greatest freshman college runners ever, as we come to find out in paragraph 38. It also gives Paul a way to help Mr. Leonard, becuase Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has troubles reading too. Paul starts training Mr. Leonard after he finds out all the information (paragraph 46), this brings the two closer together as friends, since Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard (paragraph 45).
20618	8	0	The effects on paul was that he didnt know that Mr. Leonard was like that in collage.
20626	8	2	As Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he is a bit moved. He realizes though he is becoming good at hurdles, he needs to learn to read so he doesn't become like Mr. Leonard. He also realizes then that education comes before athletics. Paul can relate to all of this, because he is in that current situation. In 45 it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-- feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew. Paul then decides that Mr. Leonard has done him a favor, and has helped him reach a goal... to excel at something. 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him (Line 48). Paul realizes that he needs to excel in academics now, and help Mr. Leonard in the process.
20636	8	0	The information makes Paul realize that Mr. Leonard needed help with schoolwork to. He found out he was a good hurdeler but couldnt do college work and wanted to help him.
20663	8	0	Both Mr. Leonard and Paul were not very good students in school. Mr.Leonard was amazying in track but since he did not get good grades in class he lost he scholarship and flunked out of school. Paul is not very good in class either. When Mr.Leonard helps him learn how to jump hurtles good he had him go out for the boy track them. In a way they are exactly the same.
20666	8	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, yet he had to drop out because of his lack of intellegence. This helps paul to connect more to his coach and want to work hard for Mr. Leonard, and have Mr. Leonard work hard for him.
20673	8	1	The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to Paul. The feelings of embarrassment when Paul was called upon to read aloud or when  he didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
20684	8	2	The coach gives Paul a website to go to. On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles. The next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off. He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read. This inspired paul knowing that Mr. leonard took the time out of his day to help him that's why paul is hepling him learn to read.
20686	8	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him.  They both can't read but are willing to try and get better at anything.  At the end of the story, Paul tells Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'
20693	8	1	Paul learned beckground information about Mr. Leonard that was revelant to his own life. Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler but was awful at reading. Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard failed out of college for not being able to read. Paul knows that he is not very good at reading and being in this remedial program will help him learn to read better and maybe one day he will go to college for hurdles but not fail out.
20696	8	0	Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard because he has the same problems as him. At the end of the story, Paul says to Mr. Leonard, indirectly, that he was going to help him learn how to read.
20699	8	1	I believe that the information that he learns about Mr. Leonard makes him have a very close connection with him. He realizes that his life is a lot like Mr. Leonard's life but that he has a chance to change his future.
20706	8	1	When Paul got background information on Mr. Leonard that effected Paul to, feel like he isn;t the only one that has a reading problem at school and couldnt read that well. And it also made him feel just like Mr. Leonard, because he was always pick lasted for a team so he also started training and got really good at sports so he wasnt chosed last anymore.
20715	8	0	It makes Paul seem more able to read by using an adult who has trouble reading as another example. It also makes paul feel less inferior to Mr. Leonard. At the end of the story Paul makes a statement that begins the idea that Paul then helps Mr. Leonard with reading.
20724	8	1	When Paul found out that Mr.Leonard was a good track star and that he didn't go to college because he couldn't read, it reminded Paul of his self.
20725	8	2	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants Paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense. Mr. Leonard also is not good at school like Paul and wants to give Paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for Paul.
20731	8	1	The background information has a big effect on Paul. It motivates Paul to do even better, since him and Mr. Leonard had similar problems in school.
20740	8	1	Paul realized that even though your not good at one thing that you can't be good at something else. Just like when Paul talks about he knows the feeling of embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he did'nt know an anwser everyone else knew. Paul realized Mr. Leonard gave his time to help him excel at something and that its okay to not be good at something you just have to work at it harder.
20741	8	2	Mr. Leonard's past motivates Paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
20743	8	1	It reminds him of himself and makes him think he will turn out just like Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college and since Paul can't read either he probably thinks that he will end up doing the same and flunking out of college.
20754	8	1	It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did. And why he had taken a liking to Paul becasue when Mr.Leonard was younger he was alot like Paul, so i can only figure that it helpred Mr.Leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in Paul.
20768	8	2	The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard gives him a curious feeling. He wondered what happened to Mr. Leonard. As it turns out Mr. Leonard can't read which is the same problem that Paul had which caused the two to meet. Since Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run hurdles Paul felt he should teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
20771	8	1	It has a positive effect on Paul. It makes him want to strive to be better than Mr. Leonard.
20775	8	1	Paul is very impressed about what he hears about Mr. Leonard. The next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler. Paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and Mr. Leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away.
20784	8	2	I believe that when Paul knows the truth about Mr. Leonard, he is more motivated to start learning and willing to work harder on hurdling. His relationship with Mr. Leonard also increases and he comes to respect him.
20787	8	2	The background that Mr. Leonard gives Paul. Makes Paul think that they are the same because they both can't read. Mr. Leonard and Paul are both good at hurddles.
20789	8	2	The narrator is surprised at the information. He never expected that Mr. Leonard was a track star.
20791	8	0	When paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. leonard. Paul wondered
20799	8	0	He wants him to be as good as he can be for the sport that he is going out for and learn as much as he can to be prepared for what he is about to get into he is going out for training to get as good as he can at it
20804	8	0	Leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times. He never gave up. Paul learned alot from him and he used that in life.
20805	8	2	Mr. Leonards background information gives Paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read. It also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since Mr. Leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school. When Paul realizes how much Mr. Leonard and him have in common, it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life.     Mr. Leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard. He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run. He soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship. No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read.
20817	8	1	Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was just like him and he acomplished something great. It inspires him by showing him that you can accomplish many things even if you aren't great at others.
20824	8	1	Mr. Leonard's background information effects Paul. Paul realizes he could be like Mr. Leonard because neither of them ccan read proficently.

20849	8	1	its the fact that they both cant read.
20851	8	2	The background information has an effect of Paul because he gets to know a person better and is therefore not the only one who can't read and feels better.
20853	8	1	There is a simlairies that Mr.Leonard shaw potential in Paul and wanted Paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so Paul wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard.
20857	8	1	The narrator is, in a way, just like Mr. Leonard. He will want to get better at reading and stay in school so he can go on with track through college.
20859	8	2	The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was also a great hurdler, but flunked out of college for not being able to read, it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles. Paul is a little shocked when Mr. Leonard says that he was a hurdler in college, but could not read. Paul shows this in paragraph 43. Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
20862	8	2	Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler. Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals, Mr. Leonard even broke records. When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship. Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading.

20889	8	1	Paul feels sorry for Mr. Leonard, because he understands and can relate to how he feels. Mr. Leonard's past of 'feelings of embarrassment,' were Paul's present life.
20894	8	2	The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help. He was confused on what happened since Mr. Leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman. Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete, but not a good student. He could not read. And Paul wanted to help. He wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read, because Mr. Leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training.
20896	8	2	The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him. He is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like Mr. Leonard is. In paragraph 45 Paul starts to change his mind about Mr. Leonard.

20908	8	2	The effect that the backround information had on Paul was exciting. He finds it very surprising that Mr. Leonard was such a remarkable athlete. He says ' You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals. You broke records.'

20945	8	0	he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort. there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best.

For example 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew'
20962	8	0	The effect Paul gets from reading about Mr. Leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him. After paul knew why he flunked out of college, he took Mr. Leonard too the learning center.
20963	8	1	The effect it has on Paul is that, Paul can relate to it. He knows what it feels like to be embarrassed about not being able to read.
20968	8	2	All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
20979	8	2	When Paul gets the URL from the coach to check out Mr. Leonards background, he could not believe it. This guy was just like Paul. He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
20980	8	2	When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read, he understands Mr. Leonard's feelings about flunking out of college. Paul also knows why he was asked what his name was even tho Mr. Leonard sees his pass every day. It also explains why Mr. Leonard did get suspicious about Paul leaving class early.

He relied on scouts to choose him for college as a hurdler. Paul is a discouraged kid. He cant read, and he is not athletic.     Mr. Leonard sees himself in Paul and gets him into doing hurdles. He knows if Paul can work hard out on the track, and get his confidence up, then he can work harder in school.     It was good for Mr. Leonard to help Paul, because he was once in his situation.

This made Paul more comfortable because someone understands him. This is supported in paragraph fourty five where it states, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'
21676	8	1	I feel Paul was suprised that Mr. Leonard was such a good athlete and didn't tell Paul about it. By Paul saying 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul is showing that he might be mad that Mr. Leonard did not tell him.
21679	8	2	Mr. Leonards background information greatly influences Paul. In the story, Paul is faced by the obsticle of a being a slow reader. When Paul meets Mr. Leonard and starts to train with him, Paul quickly discovers that Mr. Leonard has broke records in college track. Paul is inspired by the fact that Mr. Leonard, a great athlete, is training him. What inspires Paul even more is the fact that Mr. Leonards also was a had a hard time with his reading. By hearing about someone who has the same problems as him, Paul is inspired to work even harder at both his reading and his track.
21680	8	2	After Paul hears Mr. Leonard's background story, Paul responds by asking for Mr. Leonard to follow him back to the school. Paul feels the same way as Mr. Leonard does about not being a good reader. So as a result of Mr. Leonard helping him with his confidence, Paul decides to return the favor and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
21687	8	2	Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was also a track star, and he is in amaze. The track coach and Paul had realized he was getting coached by someone great. But Paul also realized that him and Mr. Leonard had a lot in common, and it inspired him.
21688	8	1	The effect that this background story has on paul is that those words reminded him of himself and 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words we all too fmiliar to me' He kne about the ' feelings of embarrassment' He felt obliged to help Mr. Leonard since he had helped paul excel in something.
21691	8	2	Paul learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college. He realizes that he needs to work hard in school. His talent will not get him far in college. He also realizes that Mr. Leonard was helping him by getting him involved in other things.
21692	8	2	It has a pretty big effect on paul because he has the same problem. So when Mr. Leonard helps Paul out with track, it makes it where Paul can try to help Mr. Leonard out with reading.
21699	8	0	The effect the background information had on Paul was that Mr. Leonard also had trouble with reading. In the article it says, 'No other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.'
21710	8	1	Paul had almost the same background as Mr. Leonard. Paul  was going threw probems like Mr. Leonard did in school. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he could do amything only if he tried.
21717	8	2	Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in his running days. Mr. Leonard tells him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good enough student. We had no learning centers in our school.'This influenced Paul to work harder at both track and reading. He also wanted to assist Mr. Leonard in reading.
21721	8	2	The background information given allows Paul to connect to Mr. Leonard. Both Paul and Mr. Leonard had reading disabilities. In paragraph 6, Paul tells Mr. Leonard that he can't read, and that is why he is going to the Learning Center. Later on in the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in hurdles as well. Paul asks why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him when he was coaching Paul. Mr. Leonard then tells Paul, in paragraph 44 lines 4-5, that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. This connects Paul and Mr. Leonard. Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
21725	8	2	When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background, that he flunked out of college, Paul was very understanding.  Paul was undergoing the exact same thing that Mr. Leonard was; Paul couldn't read.  Paul knew how it must have felt for Mr. Leonard to explain his past to Paul.  For example, in paragraph 45, the narator, Paul, says, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  In that quote, Paul explains that he went through the same thing, and feelings that Mr. Leonard was going through when he told Paul that he flunked out of college.  Paul understood clearly what Mr. Leonard felt.
21729	8	0	Paul doesn't like on how they are getting a background check on Mr. Leonard.
21734	8	2	He understands the Mr. Leonard and paul weren't so different because they both had trouble reading and didnt think they needed help.
21747	8	0	The short story is a pome.You can tell by the number's on the side.And how it riten
21749	8	1	He realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot by him with his reading disability and how its embarrassing when they are called on to read aloud. Also, he feels greatful for the time he has helped him to excel in something.
21750	8	1	The backround information makes Mr. leonard and Paul become even closer because both couldn't read. Paul understands what Mr. Leonard went through, and he is willing to help him.

23548	9	1	The author organized this article with sections.  First, he started with an intro, and then went in to sub-sections and described what the headings were about.
23562	9	1	The author begins by getting the reader's attention. Then he or she explains what space junk is and how long it's been around. After that, the author gives many reasons why space junk is so dangerous.
23570	9	1	The author starts off by getting your attention with shocking statements that you didn't know about. Then explains what is Space Junk which is space capsules, telescopes, and satellites in the Earth's atmosphere. The Crash Course tells you how satellites, space capsules, and telescopes have collided in space and are very hazardous. Little Bits, But a Big Deal describes how people are getting mad from all of this happening because something could land on earth.
23571	9	1	The author puts it in different sections. There are 3 sections after the introduction and they all have supporting evidence. Each section title apropriately fits what information is in that section.
23575	9	1	The author organizes this article by giving the readers information on what has happend in space for over the past 52 years. From then the aurthor starts talking about how one little thing such as a tool bag flying in space can cause a lot of harm to a satelite or a space craft. The author lets the readers know exactly whats going on in space.
23579	9	1	The author organizes the article by first catching your attention to make you aware, then sxplaining exactly what they are talking about. Then, after describing what space junk is, they describe how it can go wrong, and after that, how it can be harmful.
23582	9	1	The author organizes the article by seaperating it in different sections.
23592	9	1	He starts out at sharing how space junk is harmful.  Then he goes into talking about invastions and how they are created.  Dead satellites then have a good chance of colliding with each other.  He shares how some people may not think that space trash is a problem, but it really is.  He shares why some people make a big deal about it.  They make a big deal because it is one.  It is hurting the Earth.
23600	9	2	The author organizes the article according to topic. For example: in subsection What Is Space Junk?, the author explains exactly what is space junk. In the other two subsections, they are once again organized by topic. Crash Course talks about crashes of space junk and Little Bits, But a Big Deal talks about micro-debris.
23604	9	1	He organizes it by starting off with what the article is about, then moving through to what exactly it is he is talking about, where some of what he is talking about came from, and why it is important.

23614	9	2	The author organizes the passage by an introduction into some of the common things that can be found in orbit around the planet. Then the author tells us about the history of countires sending artificial satellites, starting with telling us about when the first one was launched.     Next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide. In the Febuary of 2009, two satelites, one American and one Russian, bith collided with eachother. Both of the satellites where considered disabled, and would've been much easier to remove if they were still in solid pieces. Now, they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision.     Finally, the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something. In space, even tiny particles will cause some major damage.

The author then moves on to describe exactly what is space junk. He includes a little history regarding space operations as well as their purpose and the negative outcome they can have. The autho then goes on to state the dangers of dead satellites in space as they can crash into each other. He uses two example. The first one is the crash of a Russian and American satellite crashing into each other creating debris left in space. The second one, being the tool bag which escaped from the grip of an astronaut doing repairs. The author's conclusion highlights the dangers of the debris in space and what they can do.

Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.  So, in a more general form we are hooked into the story, then given a problem, then the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why it's a problem, and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem.  This method of organization ensures that the reader is never confused, and is given the information in a logical order, answering the reader's questions directly as they come.
24362	9	2	The author organizes this article by separating the information into different sections, each focusing on one aspect of the main subject, with each individual section leading into the next. In the first section, for example, the main idea is introduced through a creative opening that grabs the reader's attention and provokes interest in the topic. The next section then offers a more elaborate explanation of the topic of the article and a short history of how the problem of 'space junk' began. The author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur. The last section then explains why the collisions are a problem, despite the small size of the debris. In this way, the information from each section builds upon what was presented in the preceding section, but each has its own specific topic. As this is an informational article, it is arranged in a logical order to provide the best understanding of the facts.

24380	9	1	He goes based on in order of which things were descovered of happen in time. From starting out when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite. Then with the crash of the two communication satellites. Then he ends it with information on different things in space right now.
24384	9	0	The author organizes the article by first introducing the gist or plot of the article and then using ending statements that give a sense of closure for the current sub-topic and an introduction for the next. Like in paragraph 5, line 15-17.
24387	9	1	The author organizes this article by naming off sections. The author describes in each section what the question is asked in the title of that particular section. The author describes the harmful things and describes what they can do.
24402	9	2	The author organizes the article in order to create a detailed introduction, explanation, and conclusion. The author begins by creating the introduction, showing the beginning of space exploration. As the author continues through the essay, he/she adds factual information on the hazards of space debris. This allows the reader to have background knowledge on space debris, and then have factual information about the disasterous debris. Finally, the author has a conclusion, which includes specific examples of space debris disaster and the chances of more catastrophe in the future. 'In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration' (Orbiting 1). The author concludes how space debris has become a serious obstacle in modern space exploration.
24410	9	2	The author begins the article with an attention grabber. The author does this in order to place excitement into the article straight from the beginning. Then the author asks the question, 'What is space junk?' and follows it with a historical answer. The author goes into detail about the amount of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satelites, that have been launched into space over the last 52 years.     With all of this stuff in orbit around the earth, many things can crash and become space debris. This poses a threat to future space missions because bits of junk flying at intense speeds can cause harm to a spacecraft or an astronaut. After explaining the possible harms of space junk, the author starts to explain that NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Agency) is trying its best to find a solution to this problem, but has not found one yet.
24420	9	2	The author organizes this article into four main sections.  The first of these sections is the introduction, where he grabs the reader's attention with an observation and the problem we are facing.     In the second section of this article, the author goes on to further explain the problem and how the problem is caused. The author begins with the first time a satellite was sent into space and how the satellite may eventually become another piece of space junk by malfunctioning.     In the third section titled 'Crash Course', the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse.  He says that if two of these malfunctioning satellites collide with each other, they would create hundreds of pieces of debris.     In the fourth and final section of the article, the author states that many people are concerned about this problem and how it will affect us.  Spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology.

24546	9	2	The article is a well organized piece. It starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that 'space junk' is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more people's attention. It then goes in to defining what 'space junk' is, as well as the 'great space invasion.' In the third section, it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space. Finally in the last section, it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about. It also presents a solution.

24596	9	2	The author organizes the article from catching the reader's attention in the opening paragraph and later lets the reader know what the paragraph is supposed to be about. The paragraph shows the problems with satellietes and this is shown form 'What Is Space Junk' all the way through to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. In order to grab the reader's attention you must try to find a way that helps people be attracted to your work and this author used statements such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!'.
24604	9	2	The author organizes this article in to different columns stating with an intuduction. These cloumns include 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This makes the article much easier to understand

24621	9	0	The author first states his opinion and the reasons behind it. Then they give the reader some details ad facts to back up his observation. They gave examples of past experiences involving cluttered space. The rest of the article is information and examples surrounding the problem.
24624	9	0	yet the problem is certain to persist.
24627	9	2	The author organizes the article by seperating it, and breaking it into sections,like 'Orbiting Junk' talks explains what space junk is then tells the reader it is a great concern to the government of space agencies around the globe. then there's 'what Is Space Junk?',which explains whats happen over the past 52 years. Then  'Crash Course', tells the reader about the risk of colliding satellites with eachother. Then the reader goes to  'Little Bits But a Big Deal', which explains how bits of space debris present a very serious problem, how tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the carefully designed spacecraft. The articel being organized  helps the reader stay interested and understand better.
24633	9	1	The author explains about space junk and tells what it is and what it does.  Also it explains why it's harmful and dangerous. The crash cource explains what happens when there is to much junk. So that is how the artlicle is explained.
24641	9	1	He asks questions in the beginning, he goes into a history lesson and then he closes with a thought that there needs to be a solution.
24654	9	2	The author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way. They first describe what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. They do this by giving a short history on the space invasion and a short explanation on how a satellite can 'die' and hurtle uncontrolably through space. Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course'. They explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the Earth at incredible speeds. They also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth. In the final section, 'Little Bits, Big Deal', the author shows how dangerous this debris can be if it is traveling at a high rate of speed. The author provides startling evidence that microdebris can puch holes in spacecraft to inform the reader on the dangers of space junk.
24674	9	1	I would say that the author organized this passage in a way of most important and which came first. In the passage 'What Is Space Junk', it talks about how satelites began and the last passage 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal',
24679	9	0	he gives lots of information throughout the article.
24681	9	2	The Author organizes this article in three different sections. They start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about, space junk. Then they go on to give one way that space junk is effective and what it does to our outer space. Finally the author tells us about how even though space junk is very small and not many know about it or realize, it is very effective.
24692	9	2	The article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite and how the United States followed along behind them. Next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other, functioning satellites, and even space ships. In the last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous. For example, even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts. The overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history, give you examples, and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause.
24705	9	2	The first paragraph is to get the readers attention, and make them want to read the story. Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk?' and because more serious. This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it.     The next section is called 'Crash Course' and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide, and it gives example of this happening in February 2009 with two communication satellites.     Section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section, and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter. The section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts, and our space crafts that we send into space. The last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing, and is still a problem. All nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem.
24708	9	1	The author first used a hook to catch the reader's attention by using a question. Then he explained what space junk was, how satellites can crash into each other, how space debris is a big deal, how space debris is harmful, and how they are trying to come up with a solution for it.
24711	9	0	IT WAS NOT ORGANIZED WELL
24717	9	1	He grabs your attention with a little action. Then he explains what space junk is and it can damage space things. How little things make a big deal.
24734	9	2	The author starts off the passage with a comical line, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a . . . tool bag?' From their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be. Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space.
24740	9	0	to make it sound like its a big deal that space junk is a big problem so he gets peoples attention.
24745	9	1	He talks about the history of Space and how we have satellites. Then talks about the importance of saellite debris and how it can be very dangerous.
24747	9	1	He starts of with a attention getter and goes into the seriousness of the essay. then he explains how thesse things happen and shows just because they are small doesnt mean they are not effective.
25957	10	1	light gray :: i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons. in summer the light gray will reflect some o f the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside, in winter the ligh t gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside .
25958	10	2	white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to ho t because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the w hite lid had an averge of 42 degrees. There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside.
25984	10	1	white ::  It should be white. The white lid average was 42(DEG)C and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experimen t.
25987	10	1	black :: The black doghouse would keep you warmer in t he winter but it would be really hot in the summer
25990	10	0	light gray ::  I chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad.
26003	10	1	white :: Because white does not asborb as much energy so it would be cooler in the dog house.
26005	10	1	white ::  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot.
26014	10	1	white ::  I would use white paint because it would keep the doghouse cooler. The doghouse will be cooler because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the doghouse cooler.
26022	10	1	white ::  the color white would keep the dog house nice and cool inside in a hot summer day.
26024	10	2	white :: In the expirement is stated that light er col ors are cooler than darker colors.White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot.
26034	10	1	black :: If you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker.
26045	10	0	black :: it might blow it up
26046	10	1	white :: this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
26047	10	0	white :: it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
26048	10	2	white :: it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better. as it said in the r esults, it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree's Celcius
26049	10	2	light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black. The color black which absorbs a lot of energy, results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures. Based on the experiment, the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures. Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray.
26056	10	1	dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
26061	10	1	dark gray :: it might get a little warm in the day time bu t it will keep the inside of the dog house warm in the night.
26076	10	2	light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse L IGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45(DEG) and for black it was 53(DEG) a nd dark grey 48(DEG) and for white was 42(DEG) light grey is the averag e of them all, 53 ( black) - 48 (dark grey) = 5 53 (black) - 45 ( light grey) = 8 and 53 (black) -42 ( white) = 11 light grey (8) is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house.
26079	10	1	light gray :: the color would keep the dog house cooler tha n the darkgrey and black color.also its warmer than the white colored hou se.
26090	10	0	black ::  so the dog will stay warm at night.
26103	10	1	black :: black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
26105	10	2	white :: White. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18(DEG) C. In the experiment, the starting temperature of was 24(DEG) C and after ten minutes under a lamp, the air inside the jar increased by 18(DEG) C. To tal of 42(DEG) C. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high.
26108	10	1	white :: White would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black, dark grey, or light gray.
26118	10	1	white :: In the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot.
26120	10	0	light gray :: because it stays at a liveable temp. of 45 de grees.
26126	10	1	light gray :: Because you dont want the dog house to be to cool or to warm.
26133	10	2	white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat. The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat, so it will keep the doghouse cooler.
26136	10	1	white :: White reflects more sun, keeping the dog cool er in the summer heat.
26138	10	2	dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time. When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold.
26143	10	2	black ::  In my oppinion, Brandi and Jerry would want t o paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors. I think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm, but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be.
26154	10	1	black :: It would make it really hot inside the doghou se because the color black attracks more heat, As aposed to colors that a re very bright like white or light gray or light green even.
26166	10	1	light gray :: It makes the doghouse a little cool but not t oo hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there a nd rest. On colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still b e a little warm.
26174	10	0	white :: less heat will be attracted to it.
26179	10	2	black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)
26183	10	1	black ::  The dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy.
26186	10	1	black ::  The color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also i t will affect it because the darker the color the greater the incre ase in air temperature in the doghouse.It will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy.
26204	10	1	light gray :: I would go with light gray because in the exp eriment it was at a good temperature of 45(DEG)F, Black was to hot at a temperature of 53 (DEG)F, Dark gray was a little to warm at a temerature of 48(DEG)F, And white was a little to cold at a temerature of 42(DEG) F.
26207	10	1	white :: it would make the doghouse cooler inside
26209	10	2	white :: They should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist, so if they use white it will not get to ho t in the dog house.
26210	10	2	light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gr ay because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53(DEG)c and 48(DEG)c in the experiment, so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around, they probably already are hot enough. Also if it does get cold, light gr ay will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temp erature was 48(DEG)c which is only 2(DEG)c less than dark gray, so i th ink light gray will be the best color for the dog house.
26213	10	1	white ::  white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy, which is shown on the data chart. it has an average tempature of 41(DEG)C versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53(DEG)C.
26214	10	1	dark gray :: dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8(DEG)c
26217	10	1	black :: if it was color black it would make the dog h ouse hot.
26229	10	1	dark gray :: dark gray may attract more heat to the dog ho use but no as much as black.
26234	10	2	black ::  With the color black as the dog house the ins ide temperature will be much hotter than the temperatures of the other co lors because the average temperature for black on the experiment wa s 53(DEG)C, for dark gray ave. temp. was 48(DEG)C, for light gray it wa s 45(DEG)C ave. temp., and for the white lid the ave. temp. was 42(DEG) C. controlled varible: temp. in jar before starting exp. responding:air temp. inside jar after 10 min. uder lamp manipulated: lid color
26244	10	2	black :: I think black would beb best to use for the d oghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out, the black color o f the doghouse will keep it warmer. Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors. Black was 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, while white was 42(DEG)C that is a change of 11(DEG)C warmer then the other.
26251	10	1	dark gray :: The tempeture inside the dog house will be wa rm.
26261	10	2	white ::  White would be the best color to paint the do g house. In the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat, stayi ng at a temperature of around 42(DEG). This would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog.
26274	10	0	white :: decrease the tepmpature
26291	10	2	black :: The other colors had between 40(DEG) and 50(DEG) but black is hotter then the other colors.
26299	10	2	white ::  White would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black, light gray, or dark gray because its the lightest color. This is good because in the summer, if the dog house attracted a lot of heat, the dog could over heat and get sick. The black lid got the hottest air temperature, having an average of 53(DEG)C, dark gray was the second hottest, having an average air temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest air temperature, on average being 45(DEG)C, and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42(DEG)C. These results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat, and is therefore why I believe that a white dog house would be best.
26300	10	0	dark gray :: The Dog house will be warm but it will probab ly always stay around the same temperature because in the trial Dark Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
26301	10	1	light gray :: Light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm. As you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e &amp; it was hot the dog which could harm the dog, and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing, so I believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors.
26308	10	0	black :: Black Will Efect The Dog House Alot In The Su mmer Because Balck Is An Energy Color.
26319	10	2	black :: In the experiment the black lid on the jar he ld the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature ins ide the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature. The black l id had the highest average temperature of 53(DEG)C, dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had an average of 45(DEG)C and white had the lowest temperature with 42(DEG)C
26345	10	0	light gray :: If you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp. of the inside of the doghouse.It would ke ep it warm inside if it was cold outside.
26352	10	0	white ::  the color white would be a good color for a d og house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2(DEG) in side the jar thats only went up 18(DEG)
26356	10	2	black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
26358	10	2	dark gray ::  -they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer, if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer. - this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer. -the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48(DEG), the black kept it at 53(DEG), the light gray kept it at 45(DEG), and the white kept it at 42(DEG). thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot. if they used the white the dog house would be too cold. the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog.
26373	10	1	dark gray :: This color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer. Therefore, this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment t hey did, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45(DEG), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, and the ligh test was cooler.
26376	10	1	white ::  White will attract a less amount of heat to t he doghouse. It is the best paint color because it will provide shelter f or the dog from the sun and provide a cooler environment.
26402	10	2	dark gray ::  I chose the color Dark Gray Because when it i s cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold. But when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool.
26412	10	1	white ::  the test proves white dosent get as hot as ot her colors
26413	10	2	white ::  the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as d oes darker colors, for example, in the air temprature expeirament. they p ut a dark colord lid over a jar, with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. but when they p ut the lighter coverd lid over the jar (at a starting point of 24c) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c. so the be st choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog.
26418	10	0	white ::  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
26419	10	0	black :: be geos once you go black u never go back
26427	10	0	black :: i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es.
26434	10	1	white :: is because on a hot day it wont be as hot in the doghouse if you use white if you use b-lack the dog would be to hot.
26443	10	1	light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog; a comfortable te mperature for the dog.
26448	10	1	dark gray :: the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold.
26452	10	2	black :: This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors. Dark gray's average temperature was 48 d egrees celcius, light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius, and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius.
26454	10	0	white :: It might affect it by the (DEG)c level in th e dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it a h otter tempature.
26459	10	1	dark gray :: That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold.
26461	10	1	dark gray :: I think that a dark gray would be the best co lor to paint the dog house. Sense dark colors attract solar heat...but it all depends on where the dog house will be located...for example...if yo ur somewhere where its normally hot outside...you should paint the house white or light gray. But if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside...paint it dark gray or black.
26467	10	1	light gray :: Light gray might not affect the dog house bec ause in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark. The dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right.
26477	10	1	black :: Darker colors attract and absorb more light s o if you paint the doghouse black then the sun's rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the dog house warmer.
26478	10	1	light gray :: it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle.
26490	10	2	white :: White is a very light color. But with black i t attracts the sun. so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot. b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53(DEG)c as the black had. the white had a average of 42(DEG)c which is not hot comp ared to 53(DEG)c.
26505	10	2	white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors. This is because, the average air temperature of the jar w ith the white lid was 42(DEG)C, the light grey lid was 45(DEG)C, the da rk grey lid was 48(DEG)C, and the balck lid was 53(DEG)C. The differenc e between the darkest (black) lid and the white lid was 11(DEG)C.
26514	10	0	white :: IT WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE THE WHITER THE COLO R THE BETTER BEACAUSE IT WILL NOT ABSORB THAT MUCH ENRGY .
26520	10	2	light gray :: The light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures, but will also absor b enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semi-warm environment. Whil e the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar-air temper ature of 53(DEG), that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment. However, if we look at the white lid, it had an average temperature of 42(DEG). That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler. However, the light gray lid had an average of 45(DEG) in the tr ials. Its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balance d environmetn for the dog to live in.
26526	10	2	"black :: Black (darker) colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source (lamp) and keep it heated up inside the dog house. Like the ""Air Temperature"" experiment, the black lid color, had 54(DEG)C while the white lid color had a 42 (DEG)C, proving that the darker the color there is, the more heat is absorbed, keeping it more warm."
26530	10	0	dark gray ::  not a lot just a agents the sun
26534	10	0	white :: i think white because it would keep the most heat out
26536	10	2	dark gray :: This color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble. The average temperature of the Dark Gray lid was 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG) C cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid, which was the Black lid, and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature.
26544	10	2	black :: this would make the doghouse very hot and unc omfortable because, as shown in the expirament, black attracts heat bring ing more thermal energy to the dog house than other colors such as white.
26546	10	0	black :: The color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of the's four colors.
26548	10	1	black ::  the black is going to make it a lot warmer in side the dog house
26568	10	2	light gray :: light gray because it wouldn't be that hot in the summer time and in would not be that cold. becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45(DEG).and that in perfect tempature
26570	10	1	white ::  The lighter the color is, the more light ener gy it reflects. If most of the light energy is reflected, the less hotter it will be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting.
26573	10	1	white :: White would be the best color. this is becaus e on average it had the lowest tempature inside, so it asorbed or blocked the most heat, it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees
26575	10	0	black :: black
26578	10	0	white :: because white is the the color that regects a ll light there for keeping the light rays from soaking in causing heat
26581	10	1	light gray ::  They don't want it to be too cold, but not to o hot either. A light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog, but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11(DEG)C. That isn't too much, so the dog won't suffocate, but it won't freeze to death either.
26583	10	2	black ::  The average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C. With a dark gray lid, the average tempera ture was 48(DEG)C. With a light gray lid, the average temperature was 45 (DEG)C. With a white lid, the average temperature was 42(DEG)C. The sta rting temperature was 24(DEG)C, so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29(DEG)C. The average temperatur e for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11(DEG) warmer than the whit e lid. Therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm, and also to kee p the dog warm in cold temperatures, black would be the best color, becau se it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar.
26588	10	1	black :: the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house.
26602	10	1	black :: it will make the dog house really hot.
26608	10	1	white ::  white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
26609	10	1	black :: it wil heat the dog house up more than the ot her colors.
26610	10	0	light gray ::  eeee
26617	10	1	black :: If you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog. Inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in. As it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture.
26619	10	1	dark gray :: dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog.
26629	10	1	black :: the inside of the doghouse would be much warm er inside the doghouse then the other colors. the black attracts more hea t.
26634	10	1	dark gray :: it wont be too hot or too cold.
26636	10	2	dark gray :: The white paint would reflect all of the ligh t rays, therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG) C air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes, but the white lid had and average of 42(DEG) C air temperature inside the jar, after 10 minutes. This is a difference of 11 (DEG) C. The white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other colo r of paint.
26637	10	2	white ::  The color White will affect the dog house, by in the summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much h eat, keeping the dog house cooler. The average temperature for the Whute lip was 42 (the coolest temperater) And the average for black was 53 (the highest) the lower the number the cooler it is. White would be the best choice for the doghouse.
26640	10	0	white :: The white paint will keep the dog house warm in the winter but won't be too hot in the summer. The average temperture of the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This way the dog will be comfortable in the house with the white paint color.
26645	10	1	black ::  in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot.
26663	10	0	light gray ::  You dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside. It will be about 45(DEG)C
26665	10	1	white :: white because it holds the least amount of he at.
26673	10	1	black :: a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold. a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors.
26690	10	0	white :: White is the best color for the dog house bec ause darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out. But white r eflects all of that heat energy
26708	10	2	white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature. It was 42(DEG)C, 43(DEG)C, 41(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C.
26710	10	0	light gray :: maybe something else was alredy that color
26721	10	1	black :: Black would be a good because it is a dark co lor and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog.
26730	10	0	dark gray ::  Dark gray is best because the temperature sta ys the same
26736	10	1	white :: white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm.
26740	10	0	white :: They Should Paint the Dog house White. If The Dog House Was whiteAnd It was a sunny day, then the dog would be hot.(do gs cant sweat.)
26752	10	2	black ::  If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer. The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it. the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
26755	10	1	black ::  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
26761	10	0	black :: Becasue darker colors absorve more enrg y .
26768	10	2	black ::  the darker the color, the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer. and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest. the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
26770	10	0	light gray ::  black is too dark and it will make the dog de peress and the white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make it dirty soon and depress. it will make the dog hyper and m ore excited.
26771	10	1	dark gray :: because it gives the inside of the doghouse a warm felling inside that would confret the dog
26772	10	2	white ::  The color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices. The average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42(DEG) C. Which is 11(DEG)C cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53(DEG)C. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice.
26781	10	0	dark gray :: The dog house would not be too hot in the sum mer if you did a dark gray, also if you chose a light gray it could be co ld in the winter, so there for dark gray would be the best color.
26786	10	0	white ::  It woulod affect the temperature inside of it .
26807	10	1	black ::  black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker, it will affect the doghous e because the house may become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
26810	10	1	light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse by not ge tting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter .
26814	10	2	white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer. In each Test, the white lid was proven to stay the coolest, the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 43 for trial 2 , 41 for trial 3, and 42 for trial 4.
26816	10	0	white ::  the white is not dark and not light, white is between that .
26818	10	1	black :: The black will absorb more enery
26823	10	1	white :: How the color white would effect the dog house is, if they painted it white it would be cooler inside the dog house. and if they painted it black it would be hotter. they should paint the dog house white so the affect makes the dog house cooler.
26842	10	1	white ::  Brandi and jerry should use white because it absorbs less heat than the darker colors.
26843	10	2	dark gray :: The color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white, or light grey. because in the experiment, th e dark grey absorbed more heat, getting an average of 48 degrees C. compa red to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42. Black absorbs more energy, at about 53 degrees C., but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer.
26856	10	1	black :: that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air. for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in t he air.
26870	10	2	"white :: White, because you want your dog to be cool e nough and according to the ""Lid color vs. Air tempature inside glass jar"" chart, white is the coolest."
26901	10	2	black :: Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors. In the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar, the air temperature will be 53 (DEG)C on average and with a white lid, the air temperature would be 42 (DEG)C on average. This shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11(DEG)C and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest.
26906	10	1	light gray :: that color will not effect the doghouse becau se the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
26912	10	0	black :: If the dog house was black it would attract m ore light from the sun to the dog house which would keep the dog warmer w hen its outside.
26920	10	1	light gray ::  Light gray would keep the doghouse warm so th e dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot.
26922	10	1	white ::  The colors affect the temperature of inside t he dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white. I chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)c. The ave rage of black was 53.25(DEG)c, dark gray 48(DEG)c, light gray 45(DEG)c , and white 42(DEG)c. All of this data was from the experiment. The diff erence is 11.25(DEG)c from lowest average to higest average.
26925	10	0	light gray :: light gray won't affect the dog house in any way.
26935	10	1	white :: White is the color most likely perfered becau se the color white doesnt absorb the suns radiations so it doesnt heat up as hot as others would.
26942	10	1	white :: In the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler.
26950	10	1	black :: it could make it to warm for the dog, it depends on the weather.
26953	10	2	white ::  White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42(DEG)C.
26964	10	2	white :: White would be the smarter choice, because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside. Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well, because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside. Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house.
26968	10	0	dark gray :: dark grey because the darker the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light grey could be to cold also.
26981	10	2	white ::  This color would be the best to pick to paint the dog house because white reflects the suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors...see if you look on the data table it shows that the avarge temerature for each color was black = 53 dark gray =48 light gray =45 white = 42 as shown on the avrages of the differnt color s it shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and t hats why i think white should be what they choose.
26986	10	2	black ::  Black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog ho use warmer inside. In the experiment when Brandi and Jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53(DEG)c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42(DEG). In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house.
26990	10	1	white :: Painting the dog house White would be very sm art if you didn't want your pet to over heat on those dreadfuly hot summe r days. Based on Brandi and Jerry's experiment the color Black gives off more 11(DEG)C opposed to the color White.
26991	10	1	white ::  that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white w ill give off less heat and the dog will stay cool.
26998	10	1	white ::  i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house.
27000	10	1	black ::  it will make it very hot in the dog house
27004	10	2	black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog hous e would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house. I know this bec ause in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar wit h the black lid was the hotest.
27010	10	2	light gray :: I think that light gray would be the best col or because it absorbs enough light to make the dog warm, without getting it too hot. Black would make it too hot, and white would make it too cold .
27012	10	2	white ::  having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat, so if you paint the house white, then there wont as much heat on the walls, making the doghouse cooler. this i s shown by the fact that in the jar experement, black had the hottest dat a and white had the coolest.
27014	10	1	white :: if they used white the doghouse would be cold er inside then it would if the doghouse was black. the reason why it woul d be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black. darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors.
27028	10	1	light gray ::  it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
27030	10	1	light gray :: The color Brandi &amp; Jerry should choose sh ould be light grey because if it was too dark, then the house would get t o hot, but if it was too light, it would be more cooler then the black, b ut it would be very dirty.
27043	10	0	dark gray :: AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
27057	10	2	black :: i chose the black color becasue that if the d og likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what c olor would be the hotes and the trials number are 54(DEG), 52(DEG), 53(DEG) ((DEG)c) and the average temp. is 53(DEG)c if the dog likes it hot in there
27063	10	1	black ::  If the weather where Brandi and Jerry live is cold, if they painted the doghouse black, it would absorb more heat than dark grey, light grey, and white.
27069	10	0	black :: dfg
27073	10	1	white ::  Because white reflects off the sun so it woul d keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light a nd would keep the dog very hot.
27076	10	2	"white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog."
27077	10	1	white :: This might affect th dog house by making it c ooler in there intead of really hot all the time.
27078	10	2	black ::  Blacks paint color would cause the inside of the doghouse to be warmer than the rest of the colors. This is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color. To prove this in Brandi and Jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the j ar warmer than all the rest. It was 6(DEG)C warmer than gray, 10(DEG)C warmer than light gray, and 12 (DEG)warmer than white. This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm.
27085	10	2	white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
27086	10	2	black :: Black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was.
27088	10	1	black :: the color black would affect the dog house by keeping it warmest because dark colors absorb light and turn it into heat.
27089	10	1	white ::  White is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs less energy then black paint would. And then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog.
27091	10	1	light gray :: Light gray because it won't be too hot diring the summer, also wont be to cold in the winter.
27099	10	1	white ::  white will effect the dog house.first this wi ll effect it because white will make it cooler in the summer,because whit e doesnt absorb very much heat.
27109	10	2	"black :: Since black is the darkest color of all the o ther colors (Dark gray, light gray, and white), because of the theory tha t darker colors absorbs more energy (heat); the inside of the doghouse wi ll be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors. The proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because bla ck is the darkest of all the other colors, and darker colors absorbs more energy, also if you look at the data table for the ""Lid color vs. A ir temperature inside glass jar"" experiment, the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray b eing 48(DEG)C, Light Gray being 45(DEG)C, and White being 42(DEG)C. Th erefore, black would be the best paint color for the doghouse."
27125	10	2	white ::  The shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53(DEG) C, and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. But I'd like to point out that Black and white aren't colors, they're shades. Get it rig ht.
27126	10	1	white :: The color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that wa y the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated.
27143	10	1	light gray :: Light gray because it wouldnt make it to hot in the dog house so ur dog could sleep comfurabley
27152	10	1	white :: Barndi and Jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun, causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable.
27153	10	1	white :: White will not absorb so much heat than the o thers.
27156	10	1	dark gray :: Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use so that the dog doesn't overheat or get too cold. The house would sta y cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Dark gray had an average tem perature of 48(DEG)C while black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C and white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C.
27162	10	1	dark gray :: dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog
27175	10	1	black :: I chose black, because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water-sprinklers; and in the winter, the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside (the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse).
27186	10	1	light gray :: The color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45(DEG) C . So from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. Also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in.
27187	10	1	light gray ::  The color will make sure the inside doesn't g et too hot or too cold.
27194	10	1	dark gray ::  This color is not to cold or to hot, it is ar ound normal temperature. After 10 minutes it should be around the same te mperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
27196	10	1	white :: Keeps the doghouse cool and does not over hea t
27207	10	2	black ::  The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house. In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius. For the lowest color, white, it was 42 degrees celcius. This means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up t he house.
27223	10	2	white ::  The white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too. The black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53(DEG)C, but the white is 42(DEG)C which is ok for the winter and the summer.
27234	10	0	white :: Because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be a light grey inside the dog house and so from tha t the dog house will be a nice shade of white with a light coat of grey o n the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the d og house.
27237	10	2	white ::  if the doghouse is painted white the air temp erature will be lower than light gray, dark gray, or black. the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. the light gray lid had an a verage temperature of 45(DEG)C. the dark gray lid had an average tempera ture of 48(DEG)C. and the black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C. therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler.
27246	10	1	black :: it will make the doghouse really warm inside because the darker the color the more it absorbs energy .
27262	10	2	black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black. He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C. In the jar with the white lid, the average tempature was 42(DEG)C. It will be 11(DEG)C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one. That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight.
27265	10	2	dark gray ::  the darker the color the warmer it is inside. and if it was black it would be to hot and white or light gray would get to cold.
27268	10	0	black :: the darker color obsorbs more heat so it woul d bi a good dog house
27272	10	0	light gray :: idk $$$
27275	10	2	light gray :: the color of the doghouse might affect the in side of the doghouse by the temperature inside. As shown in the data tab le of the experiment, the data shows that the average temperature is 45(DEG) C which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is not lowest or the highest its in the middle.
27285	10	1	white :: i would pick white because with white it stay s cooler in the doghouse than if were black to be more hotter inside.
27290	10	1	black :: It will make it so that the dog will be warme r at winter.
27291	10	2	light gray :: i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24(DEG)c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold.
27294	10	0	:: do they want the dog house to be warmer or co oler: if they want to have the dog house warm all year choose black paint . if they want ithe dog house cooler all year then chose white paint. if they want the dog house to be luke-warm chose gray paint. if they wanted it to be medeum-cold chose light gray paint. not enof info to tell what you are asking for
27308	10	2	black ::  Black was the highest tempature when under th e lamp so if Brandi and Jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose bl ack because black had an avrage of 53(DEG)c insted of other averages lik e 48(DEG)c 45(DEG)c and 42(DEG)c
27311	10	1	black :: black attracts more heat
27313	10	2	dark gray :: the dark Gray Color Is fine becuz iTs Not to dark and its not too brigth. Dark Gary had A 48(DEG)c avg And The Darkes t is black which HAd a 53(DEG)c avg also the brightest which is wh ite had a 42(DEG)c avg
27316	10	2	white :: White is the best color to paint the doghouse because, based on the experiment, dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. The hottest air temperature in the jar experiment (53(DEG)c) w as from the jar with the black lid, and the jar with the coolest air temp erature (42(DEG)c) was from the jar with the white lid, proving that lig ht colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do.
27319	10	2	white ::  By painting the dog house white, it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler. This is proven because in each trial, white had the lowest temperature. For example, in the experiment, White's average tempurate was 42(DEG), compared to black's average, which was 53(DEG); a huge difference!
27333	10	2	light gray :: This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature. According to the results of the experi ment, the colors were in this order (from the highest to lowest temperatu re): black, dark gray, light gray, white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, and get very uncomfortable. This light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the col dest temperature according to the experiment results.
27339	10	0	white :: it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
27340	10	2	black :: Black because the black had the highest numbe r the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of all of the other c olor
27347	10	0	black :: the color might effect the inside because the color of the wood.
27352	10	1	white :: White, because white paint adsorbse heat less than the darker colors, and you wouldn't want your dog to over heat.
27356	10	2	black :: If they paint the dog house black the conditi ons in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they p ut the black lid on the jar. So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color.
27361	10	0	white :: Ir Afeeect other people to what they may have dont to othewers and atht jksdjoiauy dhsaj 3 hfgyunashgygajshu\
27365	10	2	black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower.
27369	10	1	dark gray :: By painting he dog house the color dark grey might affect the dog house by making it warmer on cold nights but not to hot like the black color will make it. I think this because on the result s chart the black is a higher temp. than the dark grey and the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. In conclusion I think they sho uld paint the dog house grey because inside it it will niether be to hot nor to cold.
27385	10	1	"white ::  If they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog"
27391	10	0	light gray :: Because it made a mild temperature in the jar
27392	10	1	white :: How this color might affect the doghouse is w hen a color is lighter like the color white, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black. So when it's going to be really hot outs ide, inside the doghouse it will be cool.
27402	10	1	dark gray ::  The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because the temperature inside of the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog, but it wouldn't be too cold. It was 48(DEG)C in the jar with a dark gray lid on average. That is more suitable for a doghouse th an the black lid, which was 53(DEG)C, or the white lid, which was 42(DEG) C.
27438	10	2	dark gray ::  The color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48(DEG)C.
27440	10	2	white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray, light gray and black. also, because blacks average (in (DEG)c) was 53 dark grays average was 48. li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler.
27441	10	1	black :: black would be the best because it keeps the inside of the dog house the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
27443	10	2	white :: White would be the best color because it will be more cooler in the dog house then any of the colors above. In t he data table with black paint, the average was 53 ((DEG)C). The w hite paint, the average was 42 ((DEG)C). So that shows that if you go fo r light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it reall y hot then go for the dark colors.
27444	10	0	black :: 1:The dog will be feeling like fanetting. 2:The dog will gett thirsty. 3:The dog will breath reeally hard.
27450	10	2	light gray ::  In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use a light grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature.
27458	10	1	black :: this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son.
27460	10	1	light gray :: it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
27462	10	0	black :: they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color.
27463	10	1	dark gray :: The temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold.
27469	10	2	black :: the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy. black is the warmest in the investigation for the lamp and colo r of the lid it got an average of 53(DEG) C. the lightest color (white) got an average of 42(DEG) C.
27475	10	2	white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42(DEG)c and blacks average is 53(DEG)c
27479	10	1	black ::  The color black because it would be warm in t he doghouse. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep th e dog warm rather than cold.
27481	10	2	dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry used the color dark gray for their doghouse that would be the best color because it would keep the doghouse warm and cool depending on the seasons. The color dark gray in the jar experiment had an average of 48(DEG)C. That makes the temp erature of the doghouse in general, not to hot and not to cool based on t he jar experiment.
27502	10	0	black ::  brings heat in the dog house
27504	10	1	dark gray ::  Dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold.
27513	10	1	white :: Brandi and Jerry should use white paint for t here dog house because in the investagation the white paint color only ha d a 18(DEG) increase as black paint had a 29(DEG) increase. the diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11(DEG).
27518	10	2	light gray ::  This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. On average, the heat inside the jar with a light gray (45(DEG)C) was cooler than tha t of Black (53(DEG)C) and dark gray (48(DEG)C)
27549	10	1	light gray ::  this color will affect the doghouse by heatin it, but not overheating the doghouse.
27554	10	1	dark gray :: It wold make it cooler in the sumer but warme r in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat.
27555	10	2	white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c.
27570	10	2	black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.
27572	10	1	white :: white would be better because during the summ er it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house
27583	10	2	light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. I know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar, the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
